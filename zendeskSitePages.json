Features of employee experience platforms Employee experience platforms can have several features, meaning it may be difficult to determine what’s most influential to your team’s success. Here are five essential features to help you narrow down your options. Omnichannel ticketing system An omnichannel ticketing system is a support solution that consolidates multiple communication channels into a unified platform. It makes it easier for employees to manage and track incoming tickets and provides employees with a seamless experience since they can use their preferred method of communication. Omnichannel ticketing systems simplify the employee experience by letting agents view and respond to employees from a single system. The tool typically includes automated ticket routing and assignment to specific agents. AI-powered self-service AI employee experience tools use machine learning and natural language processing to address employee inquiries. Chatbots can simulate conversations with human agents, providing answers or directing employees to relevant articles in the knowledge base. AI-powered self-service provides 24/7 employee support, reducing staffing needs and lifting some responsibilities from agents. AI also has the capacity to learn from interactions over time, enabling it to become an even more powerful and effective resource with increased use. Workflows Few things can hinder performance more than convoluted workflows and redundant processes. Employee experience platforms can streamline workflows and simplify the steps required to manage the customer journey. Employee experience platforms provide a central hub for accessing information, eliminating the need to search across multiple systems. Communication and collaboration are enhanced by the addition of instant messaging platforms and shared calendars. Repetitive tasks, like PTO requests and performance reviews, can use automations to improve consistency. Reporting and analytics Employee experience software can provide businesses with data-driven insights gathered from analytics and compile them into easy-to-understand reports. The analytics can contribute to the following areas: Performance: Track key performance indicators, measure employee progress toward goals, and review results. Engagement: Send out satisfaction surveys and feedback forms and analyze sentiment. Apps and integrations Employee experience platforms should simplify operations by unifying different systems. It can assist in that area by integrating with the other apps you depend on, such as surveys software and performance tools. The more integrations a platform supports, the more functionality it has. For example, Zendesk integrates with Microsoft Teams so teams can: Escalate and resolve issues faster by updating and responding to tickets within Teams. Make it faster for your employees to get help, by creating and managing tickets directly from Teams. Improve ticket visibility by using the ticket tab in Teams to see and receive notifications on any ticket activity. Deflect incoming tickets by using Zendesk bots, only escalating to an agent for complex issues. Benefits of employee experience management software Employee experience management software can profoundly impact your organization’s success by improving employee and customer satisfaction. Here are some of the key benefits you stand to gain. Improves employee retention Employee experience software can improve employee retention by creating a positive and engaging work environment. Onboarding features and training modules set employees up for success. Optimized processes remove pain points and make day-to-day operations less stressful. Recognition and rewards systems foster a sense of belonging, leading to greater company loyalty. Enables collaboration Working from a centralized platform improves collaboration between team members and different departments by simplifying communication, document sharing, and project management. Teams can communicate in real time using features like instant messaging and video conferencing, regardless of peoples’ physical locations. Everyone can align on goals and project progress thanks to task assignment and document version control features. Boosts productivity The natural result of improving department collaboration and streamlining workflows is an increase in employee productivity. Employee experience management software removes the guesswork by clearly assigning responsibilities and facilitating communication. Performance tracking makes employees aware of their progress, letting managers know where employees need help. Reduces operating costs Increases in productivity will reduce your overall operating costs, but employee experience platforms can do even more to contribute to this goal. AI features eliminate time-consuming manual processes and automate repetitive tasks. Self-service portals and features can prevent the need to hire extra staff, allowing fewer agents to accomplish more. Leads to better customer experiences Employees play a pivotal role in driving better customer experiences, and the right software can empower employees to get it done. Employee experience tools provide easy access to customer profiles, including their history with the company and individual preferences. Employees can then use that information to personalize their service. Self-service features also assist with creating positive customer experiences by reducing wait times. How to choose the right employee experience platform Employee experience software can greatly improve the performance of your organization. For help identifying the solution that will provide you with the best return on investment, look for these traits: Total cost of ownership (TCO): When you assess different software providers, you need to look at more than just the purchase price. Add-ons, coding, maintenance, and staffing requirements all play into TCO. Fast time to value: How quickly will the software deliver on its promises? Some software can be deployed in a matter of days. Other software must be built from the ground up and may require weeks of setup and team training. Scalable: A platform with limited functionality can be cost-effective for a small business, but you’ll want the option to upgrade features as you grow. If the software you start with can’t scale with your business, then you’ll be stuck starting over with another service. Specialization: Many platforms provide general features that apply across teams and industries. If your company has specialized needs for HR, IT, or operations you’ll need to find a service with those unique features to tap into the full potential of your team. Employee experience success examples Employee experience software can have many applications within an organization. Take inspiration from these examples as you build your own employee experience management strategy. Tesco Grocery chain Tesco employs 460,000 employees across nine countries. Effectively managing an organization of that size is no small feat, but Tesco successfully does it by making its service desk as strong as it can be. The technology department fields over 40,000 tickets per week with 79 percent being resolved in just one-touch. They accomplished this by building efficient routing triggers and macros that can effectively handle every type of query. As a result, team members quickly adopted the new processes. “Zendesk allows us to treat our colleagues with as much care as we give our customers.” -Adam Bruce, head of product at Tesco One Medical One Medical provides membership-based primary care. They have a network of 1,300 employees across 70 offices in the U.S. To keep its employees happy and performing to the best of their abilities, One Medical actively tracks the data coming in from its employee experience software. The primary care company keeps a close eye on the top 10 tags and ticket issues coming into the support team to ensure no problem persists longer than is absolutely necessary. Whether it’s improving annoyances, like poor audio quality, or figuring out how to optimize email management, One Medical acts quickly. “Our customer support goal is to make sure that our employees get the help that they need, as soon as possible, so that they can deliver on our promise to members.” -Ian Wolfley, senior manager of product operations and support at One Medical USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism The USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism has over 3,400 people depending on its TechOps team. To keep their operations running smoothly, a team of just 27 staff members are entrusted with the responsibility of tracking, diagnosing, and resolving the issues that stand in the way of their departments’ success. The TechOps team gathers insights from their support requests to figure out what, if anything, is going wrong. The team looks at who the requests are coming from before diagnosing the cause and coming up with a solution, like optimizing staffing. This proactive approach has led to a 98 percent customer satisfaction (CSAT) rating from faculty, staff, and students. “Efficiency was our top priority, so I programmed automations and triggers to use Support to its fullest capabilities.” -Elena Mirzaians, former operations and communication coordinator at USC Frequently asked questions Here is additional information on employee experience software to help inform your decision-making. Who uses employee experience management software? Small, medium, and large businesses all use employee experience management software. The software benefits every industry, with some services specializing in unique requirements. Nearly every employee in a company uses the software, with processes overseen by the employee experience manager. How well can employee experience software integrate with existing HR and IT systems? Employee experience software can integrate seamlessly with a company’s existing HR and IT help desk software. Some software is limited by which systems it can integrate with, so you should select software built with the needs of HR and IT in mind. How can you measure the impact and return on investment of employee experience software? Companies can measure their return on investment by tracking KPIs like employee turnover, company revenue, and employee satisfaction. If the value gained is greater than the TCO of the software, then you’re receiving a positive return on investment.

Different types of help desk software Whether you’re a modest startup or corporate giant, there are help desk software options for your business. Depending on your company’s size, complexity, and customer service needs, each software can offer unique benefits to help your teams. Let’s look at the seven different types of help desk software. Enterprise help desks This type of help desk tool is for companies that operate on a larger scale. Enterprise help desks provide features like asset and account management, knowledge bases, collaboration tools for IT tech support, and no (or very high) limits on users. They’re an ideal option for enterprises that need to support employees and customers. IT help desks An IT help desk assists users with solving technical problems related to devices or software. IT help desks can harmonize with a searchable self-help center so users can resolve simple issues independently. They also enable access to IT members who can troubleshoot issues and help with products, processes, and services. The software creates a ticket in a centralized location for the IT team to address. Teams can easily share information, which improves communication between departments and leads to faster resolutions. The best IT software recognizes similar issues and groups the tickets together so teams can resolve multiple tickets simultaneously. HR help desks Human resource help desks—or HR help desks—help HR teams manage and solve employee matters, questions, and issues that come in from multiple channels. This platform eliminates the frustration of endless email threads by streamlining questions about benefits, payroll, and other company policies into a centralized place. Much like IT help desks, you can integrate a self-service portal with HR help desks so employees can quickly and easily search and find answers to common questions. This saves agents valuable time and allows them to handle more challenging issues. A HR help desk also provides valuable insight into recurring issues. With this information, your team can proactively create new processes to eliminate issues before they reoccur. Web-based help desks Web-based help desk software solutions—or SaaS help desk software—are platforms hosted on the software provider’s server. These help desk solutions are typically sold as monthly or annual subscriptions and include maintenance, updates, and security costs. SaaS help desks are fantastic options for small and mid-sized businesses that don’t have the budget or infrastructure to host and maintain an on-premise help desk system. Since many companies have shifted to remote work, customer service teams need the flexibility to operate from different locations. Web-based help desks let teams manage tickets quickly, access customer data securely, and provide excellent customer service from anywhere. They’re also often customizable and scalable, so your team can tailor the solution to their needs and add features and capabilities as customer service demands increase. On-premise and cloud-based help desks On-premise help desk software allows companies with strict data security needs to keep their data on their own servers (or “on-premise”) rather than on the cloud. They’re customizable and easy to interoperate with your company’s internal systems. But this requires regular maintenance that you must handle internally. Cloud-based help desk software stores data on remote servers owned by your software vendor or a third party, which offers crucial benefits for remote work environments. It enables employees to work anywhere without having to build, support, and maintain your own data center. This gives companies flexibility in how and where they use the service, and it’s typically easier to scale up and down based on demand. Open-source and closed-source help desks Closed-source help desk apps are proprietary, meaning they don’t allow you to modify the source code like open-source software. Closed-sourced software tends to be more user-friendly, and since only the provider can access the code, it’s usually more secure. The providers typically offer support to help you troubleshoot issues and make any updates. With APIs, SDKs, third-party app integrations, and plugins, there’s still plenty of room to customize closed-source help desk software. Though open-source software may technically be more flexible, only companies with highly skilled programmers can customize the software to suit their needs. Help desks for startups For small businesses in their early stages, help desks for startups can help you support your customers and employees as you grow. Joining a low-risk/high-reward program like Zendesk for Startups can help you reach your growth goals with a scalable, easy-to-use software so your teams can manage all customer interactions in one place. You’ll gain access to Zendesk products and expert resources that enable you to build a successful business strategy and expand your network. Key features of IT help desk software Here are a few key features to look for when comparing help desk software. Ticketing system A help desk ticketing system helps businesses process, manage, and track customer issues from submission to resolution. The requests are automatically organized, prioritized, tagged, categorized, and assigned to agents in a centralized dashboard. It’s important to have this feature, as ticketing software is the hub of communication between you and your customers. AI and chatbots Seventy-one percent of customers believe AI and chatbots help them get faster replies, according to our CX Trends Report. AI and chatbots can provide your messaging channels with quick and convenient 24/7 customer support. Some examples of how chatbots can help customers around-the-clock include: Providing answers to frequently asked questions Suggesting relevant help center articles Routing customers to available live agents Self-service knowledge base In our CX Trends Report, 37 percent of agents said customers become noticeably angry, frustrated, or stressed when they cannot complete simple tasks on their own. Some people prefer to skip the interaction with agents, especially regarding common questions, so creating a self-service portal can enhance the experience for that segment of your customer base. Including a knowledge base allows customers to quickly find relevant articles and resolve issues on their own, reducing the number of support tickets. Businesses like Tesco use Zendesk to enhance their internal knowledge base and self-service solution. Zendesk has helped Tesco’s help center management team contribute and edit self-service content for up to 30,000 articles per week. These self-service options have allowed agents to focus on serving customers with more complex needs, resulting in 79 percent of tickets resolved on first contact. Omnichannel agent workspace The right IT help desk software connects all your customer or employee data so you have a complete view of your users. With an omnichannel agent workspace, agents can easily access any support channel from one place, allowing you to provide a personalized experience to any user. It also makes it easy for global teams to collaborate—whether they’re fixing bugs, launching updates, or engaging with users. Reporting and analytics Help desk tracking software that features reporting and analytics gives you fast access to valuable customer insights that can help you: Identify areas of improvement so you can provide better experiences Monitor agent and team performance to see where they’re excelling and where they need to improve Understand your customers better so you can personalize interactions and improve their overall experience With a reporting and analytics solution that integrates data from every channel, you can measure how customers interact with your business and how you’re performing. Benefits of using help desk software Help desk software offers more benefits than you can shake a stick at. Here are a few common ways help desk software can help your business. Provides fast and simple IT or customer support The best help desk makes life easy for internal and external customers by allowing agents to provide simple support options. Our CX Trends Report found that 60 percent of consumers have higher customer service standards compared to previous years. Investing in online help desk programs that fit your business can provide a great customer and employee experience, resulting in customer loyalty and higher customer satisfaction. Sets support teams up for success Providing better tools results in more productive agents. When employees have a help desk that makes their jobs easier—thanks to one unified workspace, automation, and self-service options—they get time back to focus on the important stuff. They can consistently do their best work and, in turn, provide a better customer experience. Keeps your business in sync Your business will stay in sync when customer context and information, tools for tracking and analytics, and easy-to-automate workflows are all in one place. These IT help desk software features save your team from toggling between different tools to address an issue. It allows them to better understand the customer journey and focus more on the customer experience. Best practices to make the most of your help desk solution Because help desk solutions are so dynamic, there may be opportunities to better optimize yours. Here are some best practices to help you get the most from your help desk software. Make it easy for your customers Meet customers where they are and pick a help desk solution that allows you to offer support on the channels customers prefer to use the most. With asynchronous conversations, customers can start a conversation on channels like live chat, messaging, social, email, or voice, and continue it on a different channel later. Empower customers to help themselves An extension of the previous point, self-service resources like integrated help centers, community forums, and client portals enable customers to conveniently find answers themselves. When customers help themselves through self-service resources, it deflects them from reaching out to agents for support, resulting in: Fewer tickets in the queue Reduced resolution times for agents Faster service for customers Keep your business in sync through customization An open platform with customization options allows you to be flexible as your business grows and adapts to changes. Integrating customer support and CRM platforms with code and no-code functionality helps you offer better personalization, improve customer service, boost agent efficiency, and identify recurring customer issues—all in one place. Customizable dashboards allow your management teams to review support data to spot trends. You can analyze customer service metrics—like CSAT, volumes by channel, ticket volume spikes, ticket reopen rate, time to resolution, and more—to help you improve customer expectations, channel preferences, and internal and external requests. Offer intelligent support with an AI chatbot Deploy AI and chatbots to provide customers with fast, intelligent, around-the-clock support across channels. AI-powered bots can answer common questions when live agents are off the clock or help customers solve basic issues by offering self-service options. Chatbots can offer help center articles with up-to-date information to FAQs, providing customers with a convenient way to find answers on their own time. Bots also collect valuable customer information and provide context to the live agent, creating a seamless handoff experience. Personalize the experience With all your key customer data and context in one unified agent workspace, you have the information you need to tailor the customer experience and provide personalized support. Agents don’t need to toggle between systems, either. This helps boost the customer experience with rich, personalized conversations that build customer loyalty. How to choose the right help desk software With the right help desk system, support teams come equipped with all the tools they need to provide quick, personalized service. While the help desk software that’s best for your company may not be the best for other businesses, here are a few common things to consider: Low total cost of ownership Look for help desk software that can deliver efficiencies and boost productivity, leading to a lower support cost. Here are some factors to consider when calculating the total cost of ownership of your help desk solution: Out-of-the-box capabilities that reduce implementation costs System agility that doesn’t require an expensive, full-time admin team to maintain Intuitive system that boosts the agent experience Add-ons and integrations built for usability and efficiency Fast ROI and ease of implementation Help desk software with out-of-the-box functionality that sets up easily can help your business see a faster ROI. Software that integrates with your existing systems reduces implementation costs and takes less time for agents to learn. Here are a few features to look for in help desk software that can help you see a faster ROI: Intuitive, agent-friendly interface Easy customization options Simple admin Zendesk has helped many customers across industries implement their help desk software quickly, allowing them to see an ROI sooner than with other solutions. Homebridge, a financial services company, saw a 23 percent increase in their agent efficiency and a 158 percent increase in their ROI after implementing Zendesk. Scalability and agility Consider an open, flexible, and agile help desk solution that easily integrates with the rest of your tech stack. It should scale with your growing business and evolve with the changing technology. Features like reporting and analytics across channels, customizable workflows, and a single unified view help your team provide top-tier, personalized service at scale. Enterprise-grade security Pick a help desk solution that allows you to provide a great customer experience without sacrificing security. Companies that operate on a massive scale need enterprise-grade reliability and security features. Here are a few enterprise-class security features to look for: Compliant with HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, or other data protection laws and efforts Regular, comprehensive audits of applications and systems Transparency with customers about the data protection on features and functionality Dedicated account and success management Your help desk solution should make it easier for your business to manage account and customer success. Account management helps individual customers on a case-by-case basis, while customer success management considers the success of your business’s entire customer base. The right help desk can help each team perform effectively and efficiently while aligning the roles toward the common goal of business success. Collaboration tools provide customer context for a personalized experience and help unlock cross-sell and upsell opportunities. Frequently asked questions Who needs an IT help desk solution?

With a simple Chrome extension or mobile app, BombBomb allows customers to record and send video emails in a matter of seconds. To support their customers, BombBomb uses a variety of channels, including email, chat, phone and social media. But managing these channels all at once can be a challenge, and BombBomb noticed that agent productivity was suffering solutionThe team switched to the Zendesk Suite, which allows their agents to use the new Agent Workspace. Now, they work with a single set of tools and processes across channels. And with the ability to pull in relevant customer details, apps and ticket fields, they’re getting faster response times across their biggest channels — chat and email. Agents can now respond to incoming chats and follow up over email or phone from one place. Big changes at BombBomb.“Our customers reach out to us across several channels, including email, chat and phone, and we want to make sure they’re always able to reach out on the channel they prefer.

Compliance With The Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Commonwealth) and the Australia Privacy Principles In Australia, the key privacy legislation applying to Zendesk is the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). The Privacy Act applies to most private sector organizations operating in Australia and sets a national standard for the collection, use and disclosure, quality and security of “Personal Information”. In particular, the Privacy Act establishes the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) (effective from 12 March 2014) that sets out these key obligations. The APPs regulate the collection, use and disclosure of personal information, and also allow individuals to access their personal information and have it corrected if it is incorrect. There are also separate APPs that deal with the use and disclosure of personal information for the purpose of direct marketing (APP 7) and cross-border disclosure of personal information (APP 8). Further information regarding the APPs are set out on the Australian Government website Our policy is compliant with the Australian Privacy Act and the Australian Privacy Principles. The most significant of the APPs are summarized below: • APP 1 (open and transparent management of personal information) provides that entities must take reasonable steps to implement practices, procedures and systems that ensure compliance with the APPs and publish their privacy policy; • APP 5 (notification of collecting personal information) requires entities to ensure that at before, at the time of, or as soon as practicable after, an entity collects personal information from an individual the entity must take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to notify the individual of the collection of the personal information; • APP 7 (direct marketing) restricts the use or disclosure of personal information for direct marketing unless an exception applies; and • APP 8 (cross-border disclosure of personal information) requires that before an entity discloses personal information about an individual to a person or entity overseas, the entity must take reasonable steps to ensure that the overseas recipient does not breach the Australian Privacy Principles. Personal Information is defined as any information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable: • whether the information or opinion is true or not; and • whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not. This information can include customer name and contact information including postal address, email address and telephone number, billing information, credit or debit card information, and transaction information for any products that may have been purchased. We adhere to the Australian Privacy Principles for all personal information that we collect from our customers (i.e., the companies that utilize and pay for our service) and from any other individuals that we may receive or collect personal information from. In particular: • We only collect personal information of the individuals who have registered or signed up for our services (such as credit card information). Where we collect unsolicited information, we deal with this according to the APPs and our Privacy Policy; • We only use personal information for the purposes set out in our Privacy Policy and we only disclose such personal information to third party vendors to whom customers link from our service; and Where it is reasonably practicable, we will give our customers access to their personal information, delete the personal information if requested, and retain it only as necessary to provide our services to our customers. New Zealand’s Privacy Act (1993) and its 12 Information Privacy Principles (NZ IPPs) Similar to the Australian privacy principles, New Zealand law lays out 12 information privacy principles (NZ IPPs) for the proper handling of personal information of Kiwi citizens, and these principles can be found at The Act and 12 IPPs presume that trans- border data flows are permissible provided the IPPs are preserved, which are the case with Zendesk. As is the case with Australian privacy laws, Zendesk acts as the processor, not collector of the data, of its New Zealand’s customers’ customers. In addition, Zendesk’s handling of personal information under its Privacy Policy is perfectly aligned with the 12 NZ IPPs, including those directing that personal information be collected for lawful purposes (e.g., for processing customer service issues), that data should be collected directly from individuals (e.g., end users using the Zendesk platform), that notice of collection of data and purpose of the data collection is provided, that data be collected in a legal manner, or that individuals have right to access and correct their data. If you wish to make a complaint about the way we have handled your personal information (including if you think we have breached any applicable privacy laws), you may do so to our Privacy Officer in writing, by mail or email to the address or email address set out in the ‘Contact Us’ section of this Policy. Please include your full name, contact details and a detailed description of your complaint. Our Privacy Officer will acknowledge your complaint and respond to you regarding your complaint within a reasonable period of time. If you consider that we have failed to resolve the complaint satisfactorily, we will provide you with information about the further steps you can take.

The provisions of this Section 3 shall supersede any non-disclosure agreement by and between You and Zendesk entered prior to these Terms that would purport to address the confidentiality of Your Data and such agreement shall have no further force or effect with respect to Your Data. 3.2 Zendesk will maintain commercially reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of Your Data. These safeguards include encryption of Your Data in transmission (using SSL or similar technologies), except for certain Other Services that do not support encryption, which You may link to through the Service at Your election.

Any third party service providers We utilize will only be given access to Your Account and Your Data as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service and will be subject to confidentiality obligations. The Zendesk Group may also access or disclose information about You, Your Account, Agents or End Users, including Your Data, in order to (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect Zendesk Group’s or its customers’ or partners’ rights or property, including enforcement of these Terms or other policies associated with the Service; (c) act on a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to protect personal safety or avoid violation of applicable law or regulation. 3.4 We collect certain information about You, Agents and End Users as well as Your and their respective devices, computers and use of the Service.

If You are entitled to this notice and do not wish to have Your Personal Data hosted in data centers located in such other country or territory, You may terminate Your Subscription and Your Account with immediate effect upon written notice to Zendesk within thirty (30) days or Your receipt of such notice. For avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not, in any event, be deemed to limit any other manner of Processing of such Personal Data within the Zendesk Group or to authorize service providers whether in the European Economic Area, the United States or elsewhere. 4.

CREDITS POLICY 8.1 Zendesk may choose to offer credits in regards to some or all of the Service. Credits may be accumulated by You in various ways, including but not limited to, Your redemption of coupons; awarded via promotional campaigns; and referrals. Zendesk reserves the right to award credits at its sole discretion. Credits have no monetary or cash value and can only be used by You to offset Your subsequent payments of Subscription Charges to Reseller. Credits may only be applied to Subscription Charges due for the Service specifically identified by Zendesk when issuing the credit. Credits can only be used by You and are non-transferable. 8.2 To the extent that You have been awarded credits, unless the instrument (including any coupon) states an earlier expiration date, these credits shall expire and no longer be redeemable twelve (12) months from the date the credit was issued. 9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES THE SITE AND THE SERVICE, INCLUDING ALL SERVER AND NETWORK COMPONENTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AND ZENDESK EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ZENDESK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR-FREE OR FREE FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS SOFTWARE, AND NO INFORMATION OR ADVICE OBTAINED BY YOU FROM ZENDESK OR THROUGH THE SERVICE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. 10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 10.1 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) WILL ZENDESK, OR ZENDESK’S AFFILIATES OR ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST SALES OR BUSINESS, LOST DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER LOSS INCURRED BY YOU OR SUCH THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ZENDESK HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OR COULD HAVE FORESEEN SUCH DAMAGES. 10.2 NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THESE TERMS, ZENDESK’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUBSCRIPTION TO, OR USE OR EMPLOYMENT OF THE SERVICE, SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE PAYMENTS MADE BY RESELLER TO ZENDESK WITH RESPECT TO YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO THE SERVICE DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE FIRST EVENT OR OCCURRENCE GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THIS SECTION 10.2 IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND LIMIT POTENTIAL LIABILITY GIVEN THE FEES CHARGED FOR YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IF ZENDESK WERE TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER LIABILITY OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH HEREIN. ZENDESK HAS RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO PROVIDE YOU THE RIGHTS TO ACCESS AND USE THE SERVICE PROVIDED FOR IN THESE TERMS. 10.3 Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply to You. IN THESE JURISDICTIONS, ZENDESK’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 11. INDEMNIFICATION You will indemnify and hold Zendesk harmless against any claim brought by a third party against Zendesk arising from or related to use of the Service by You, Agents or End Users in breach of these Terms or matters which You have expressly agreed to be responsible pursuant to these Terms; provided that Zendesk promptly notifies You of the threat or notice of such a claim. 12. ASSIGNMENT; ENTIRE AGREEMENT; REVISIONS 12.1 Under the terms of the Reseller Agreement, Your agreement with Reseller with respect to Your subscription to the Service may be assigned to Zendesk. You agree that if the Your agreement with Reseller is assigned to Zendesk, Your continued rights to access and use the Service shall be subject to Zendesk’s then standard Terms of Service as available at and You consent to the application of such terms and conditions, including without limitation, the billing and payment provisions contained therein. You agree that following any such assignment, You shall, upon request by Zendesk, provide such information as is required to secure payment for any Subscription Term commencing after such assignment. You may not, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, assign all or any part of these Terms or Your rights under these Terms or delegate performance of Your duties under these Terms without Zendesk’s prior consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. We may, without Your consent, assign Our agreement with You to any member of the Zendesk Group or in connection with any merger or change of control of Zendesk or the sale of all or substantially all of Our assets provided that any such successor agrees to fulfill its obligations pursuant to these Terms. Subject to the foregoing restrictions, these Terms will be fully binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 12.2 You understand and agree that Zendesk may rely on these Terms, as the entire and complete agreement among You and Zendesk with respect to the subject matter hereof, and that these Terms supersede any and all prior agreements between You and Zendesk with regard to the subject matter hereof. You further agree that these Terms shall apply in lieu of the terms or conditions in any purchase order or other order documentation that You or any Entity which You represent provides (all such terms or conditions being null and void), and that, except as expressly stated herein, there are no other agreements, representations, warranties, or commitments which may be relied upon by any party with respect to the subject matter hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, additional terms may apply to certain features or functionality Zendesk offers through the Service (the “Additional Terms”). In those instances, Zendesk will notify You, directly or via Reseller, of such Additional Terms prior to the activation of these features or functionality and the activation of these features or functionality in Your Account will be considered acceptance of the Additional Terms. All such Additional Terms will be considered incorporated into these Terms when You or any Agent authorized as an administrator in Your Account activates the feature or functionality. Where there is a conflict between these Terms and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control. 12.3 We may amend these Terms from time to time, in which case the new Terms will supersede prior versions. We will notify You not less than ten (10) days prior to the effective date of any such amendment and Your continued use of the Service following the effective date of any such amendment may be relied upon by Zendesk as Your consent to any such amendment. Zendesk’s failure to enforce at any time any provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision or of any other provision of the Terms. 13. SEVERABILITY If any provision in these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as to best accomplish the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in effect. 14.

RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES The parties are independent contractors. These Terms do not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship among the parties. 16. SURVIVAL Sections 1, 3, 4 and 9-20 shall survive any termination of our agreement with respect to use of the Service by You, Agents or End Users. Termination of such agreement shall not limit Your or Zendesk’s liability for obligations accrued as of or prior to such termination or for any breach of these Terms. 17. CONTRACTING PARTY Payments made, via Reseller, by credit card, debit card or certain other payment instruments are billed and processed by Zendesk if denominated in U.S. dollars and by Zendesk International Ltd. if denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent that any such entity billing or processing this transaction (the “Billing Entity”) is not Zendesk, the Billing Entity is acting solely as a billing and processing agent for and on behalf of Zendesk and shall not be construed to be providing the Service. You are contracting with and the Service is provided and delivered by Zendesk. 18.

For a prior version of the Consulting Services Agreement, click here. This CONSULTING SERVICES AGREEMENT (“Agreement”) is by and between Zendesk, Inc., with a principal place of business at 989 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94103 (“Zendesk”) and the party clicking through to accept this Agreement or executing any Statement of Work (“SOW”) referencing this Agreement (“Subscriber,” and together with Zendesk, the “Parties”), and constitutes a binding agreement among the Parties. By accepting this Agreement or executing any SOW, Subscriber agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement shall be effective on either the date on which Subscriber clicks through to accept this Agreement or the date on which both Parties execute an SOW (the “Effective Date”). If an individual is entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company, organization or another legal entity (an “Entity”), such individual is agreeing to this Agreement for that Entity and representing to Zendesk that such individual has the authority to bind such Entity and its affiliates to these Terms, in which case the term “Subscriber” as used herein will refer to such Entity and its affiliates. Pursuant to the Terms of Service agreed to by Subscriber (“Terms of Service”), Subscriber is subscribing to the Service (as that term is defined in the Terms of Service). Subscriber wishes to engage Zendesk to receive the Consulting Services described herein, and Zendesk agrees to provide the Consulting Services under this Agreement. In consideration of the foregoing, Subscriber and Zendesk, intending to be legally bound, agree to the terms set forth below. 1. Scope. All services pursuant to this Agreement provided by Zendesk to Subscriber will be outlined in one or more in one or more mutually agreed-upon and jointly executed SOW or service order form, each incorporated into this Agreement and describing in detail the scope, nature and other relevant characteristics of services to be delivered (collectively, “Consulting Services,”). All terms not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Terms of Service, including but not limited to any reference to the “Service”. 2. Retention. Subscriber hereby retains Zendesk to provide the Consulting Services described in one or more SOWs, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The terms and conditions of this Agreement will govern the provision of Consulting Services under any SOW (including any exhibits thereto) executed by the Parties. Zendesk shall not be obligated to perform any Consulting Services until both Parties have mutually agreed upon and executed an SOW. After execution of an SOW, the Consulting Services to be provided under that SOW may only be changed through a change order mutually executed by the Parties (“Change Order”). 3. Performance of Consulting Services. 3.1. Each SOW will include reasonable details, at a minimum, about the Consulting Services, Fees charged, and Personnel employed in performing the Consulting Services. Zendesk and Subscriber agree to cooperate in good faith to achieve satisfactory completion of the Consulting Services in a timely and professional manner. 3.2. The Parties will each designate a representative to interface and facilitate the successful completion of the Consulting Services (“Subscriber’s Representative” and “Zendesk’s Representative”, respectively). Any Subcontractor (defined below) designated by Zendesk to perform any portion of the Consulting Services will designate a representative to interface with Subscriber and Zendesk on all matters relating to Subcontractor’s performance of Consulting Services (“Subcontractor’s Representative”). 3.3. Zendesk will perform the Consulting Services, directly or through a Subcontractor of its choice. Subscriber agrees to provide, at no cost to Zendesk, timely and adequate assistance and other resources reasonably requested by Zendesk to enable the performance of the Consulting Services (collectively, “Assistance”). Neither Zendesk, nor its Subcontractors will be liable for any deficiency in performance of Consulting Services to the extent resulting from any acts or omissions of Subscriber, including but not limited to, Subscriber’s failure to provide Assistance as required hereunder. 3.4. In performing the Consulting Services, Zendesk will provide such resources, and utilize such qualified employees and/or non-employee contractors of Zendesk (“Subcontractors” and together with Zendesk’s employees, “Personnel”) as it deems necessary to perform the Consulting Services or any portion thereof. Subscriber may object to Zendesk’s election of Subcontractors by specifying its objection to Zendesk, in which case the Parties will cooperate in good faith to appoint another Subcontractor to perform such Consulting Services. Zendesk may replace Personnel in its normal course of business, provided that Zendesk will be responsible for the performance of Consulting Services by all Personnel. 3.5. Zendesk will control the method and manner of performing all work necessary for completion of Consulting Services, including but not limited to the supervision and control of any Personnel performing Consulting Services. Zendesk will maintain such number of qualified Personnel and appropriate facilities and other resources sufficient to perform Zendesk’s obligations under this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 3.6. With Subscriber’s approval, Zendesk may enter (“assume into”) Subscriber’s Account as needed to provide the Consulting Services. 3.7. This Agreement does not grant any license to any of Zendesk’s, or any Subcontractor’s software or products (including, without limitation, the Service), except as specifically provided pursuant to Section 10. 3.8. In the event that Subscriber seeks to change the scope of Consulting Services to be provided under any SOW (including but not limited to any changes to the project schedule described in the SOW), Subscriber shall discuss such proposed changes with Zendesk. If Zendesk elects to perform such changes to the Consulting Services, the Parties shall work together in good faith to execute a Change Order. Zendesk shall be entitled to an adjustment in Fees pursuant to the changes reflected in the Change Order. Zendesk shall not be obligated to perform any differing or additional Consulting Services unless the Parties have mutually agreed upon a written Change Order. 3.9. For SOWs that are deliverable/milestone based, upon delivery of all deliverables or completion of all milestones detailed in the SOW, Zendesk shall provide Subscriber with written notice (“Completion Notice”). Subscriber shall then have five (5) days after the date of the Completion Notice to provide Zendesk with written notice describing any deliverables that have not been provided or milestones not met. The SOW shall be deemed complete absent Subscriber’s timely written notice of any deliverables or milestones not having been met. For the avoidance of doubt, a Completion Notice shall not be necessary for SOWs that are Time and Materials based. 4. Fees; Payment Terms. 4.1. Subscriber will pay Zendesk the fees to provide the Consulting Services as detailed or described in a SOW (the “Fees”). Unless agreed upon otherwise in the applicable SOW, Zendesk shall invoice Subscriber for the Services provided on a monthly basis. All Fees are due and payable upon date of invoice, except for Fees that Subscriber disputes in good faith for reasons articulated in writing by Subscriber within thirty (30) days after receiving such invoice. 4.2. All Consulting Services will be provided on either a time and materials or fixed-fee basis, as indicated in the applicable SOW. Each SOW providing for time and materials based Fees will contain a detailed estimate of such time and materials necessary for performance of Consulting Services (“T&M Estimate”). Zendesk will make a commercially reasonable effort to provide such Consulting Services within such T&M Estimate, up to the number of hours agreed to by the Parties. Zendesk will make a reasonable effort to notify Subscriber as soon as practicable if it appears that T&M Estimate may be exceeded. Upon receiving such amended T&M Estimate, Subscriber will assess, and accept or reject the amended T&M Estimate. Unless Subscriber rejects such amended T&M Estimate within five (5) days of delivery, such amended T&M Estimate shall be deemed accepted by Subscriber and Subscriber shall be liable for all Fees associated with Consulting Services delivered in reliance on such amended T&M Estimate. Any amended T&M Estimate which is or is deemed accepted by Subscriber shall be deemed a Change Order. 4.3. The performance of Consulting Services may be subject to a retainer to be paid in advance by Subscriber upon execution and delivery of the SOW. Such retainer will be applied against Fees which become payable by Subscriber pursuant to this Agreement. Zendesk may refuse to perform Consulting Services unless and until such retainer is paid to Zendesk. 4.4. In addition to any and all Fees, Subscriber will reimburse Zendesk for any reasonable expenses for travel, lodging, communications, shipping charges and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Zendesk in connection with providing the Consulting Services (“Expenses”). Zendesk will provide reasonable documentation for all Expenses as requested by Subscriber. Subscriber shall reimburse Zendesk for Expenses within thirty (30) days of submission of the Expenses to Subscriber by Zendesk. 4.5. Any unpaid Fees or Expenses will become overdue thirty (30) days after payment is due and shall be subject to a late fee of one and one and a half percent (1.5%) per month for each month where payment is not received. Subscriber’s failure to make timely payments under this Agreement may be considered by Zendesk a material breach of this Agreement by Subscriber, which may result in suspension of Consulting Services by Zendesk. Subscriber will be responsible for any and all taxes levied on transactions under this Agreement other than taxes based on Zendesk’s income. 5. Relationship of the Parties. Zendesk is an independent contractor and will maintain complete control of and responsibility for its Personnel, methods and operations. Zendesk at no time will hold itself out as an agent, subsidiary or affiliate of Subscriber for any purpose, including reporting to any government authority. This Agreement will not be construed so as to create a partnership, other joint venture or undertaking, or any agency relationship between the Parties, and neither Party shall become liable for any representation, act or omission of the other Party or have the authority to contractually bind the other Party. Any Fees, Expenses or other amounts paid by Subscriber to Zendesk hereunder shall not be considered salary for pension or wage tax purposes and neither Zendesk nor its Personnel will be entitled to any fringe benefits, including sick or vacation pay, or other supplemental benefits of Subscriber, unless otherwise required by law. Subscriber shall not be responsible for deducting or withholding from Fees or Expenses paid under this Agreement any taxes, unemployment, social security or other such expense unless otherwise required by law. 6. Term and Termination. 6.1. This Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will remain effective for as long as any SOW is in effect among the Parties, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Section 6. Any termination of this Agreement shall terminate any then-effective SOW. 6.2. This Agreement may be terminated by either party with or without cause upon no less than thirty (30) days advance written notice to the other Party. 6.3. Either Party may terminate this Agreement if the other Party materially breaches any obligation hereunder, provided the terminating Party has provided notice of such breach to the other Party and an opportunity to cure such breach during a period of not less than thirty (30) days following such notice. 6.4. Upon termination of this Agreement, Zendesk will immediately cease performing any Consulting Services, and Subscriber will pay Zendesk any Fees not yet paid for all Consulting Services provided pursuant to any SOW on or prior to such termination on a prorated basis (or on such other basis as the Parties will mutually agree) and reimburse Expenses incurred on or prior to termination not yet reimbursed. 6.5. Sections 4 through 16 of this Agreement will survive any termination of the Agreement to the extent necessary to implement their objectives. Termination of this Agreement will be without prejudice to other rights or remedies of any Party under this Agreement or applicable law, including, without limitation, any remedies for a breach of this Agreement prior to such termination. 7. Warranties, Limitation of Liability. 7.1. Zendesk hereby represents and warrants that: (a) it has all authority, licenses, permits, and consents necessary to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement, and will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations in performing the Consulting Services; (b) the Consulting Services provided pursuant to this Agreement will be performed in a timely and professional manner by Zendesk and its Personnel, consistent with generally-accepted industry standards; provided that Subscriber’s sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of this warranty will be, at Zendesk’s option, re-performance of the Consulting Services or termination of the applicable SOW and return of the portion of the Fees paid to Zendesk by Subscriber for the nonconforming portion of the Consulting Services; and (c) it is under no contractual or other restrictions or obligations which are inconsistent with the execution of this Agreement, or, to its best knowledge, which will interfere with its performance of the Consulting Services. 7.2. The Parties hereby agree that: (a) EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 7, ZENDESK EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, NON-SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS AND TITLE, OR ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE, AND ALL SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW. (b) CUSTOMIZED DELIVERABLES, SUCH AS, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CUSTOM APPLICATIONS THAT RESIDE WITHIN THE ZENDESK SERVICE FRAMEWORK; HELP CENTER CUSTOMIZATIONS; INTEGRATIONS; AND PROGRAMMING SCRIPTS, THAT ARE IDENTIFIED AND BEING DELIVERED UNDER A SOW (COLLECTIVELY, “CUSTOMIZED DELIVERABLE”) ARE PROVIDED TO SUBSCRIBER “AS IS” AND ZENDESK MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR ANY REPRESENTATIONS TO SUBSCRIBER OR ANY THIRD PARTY REGARDING THE USABILITY, CONDITION, OPERATION OR FITNESS OF THE CUSTOMIZED DELIVERABLE. ZENDESK SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE, AT LAW OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY CUSTOMIZED DELIVERABLE DESPITE ANY OTHER WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES, IN THE EVENT THAT SUBSCRIBER MODIFIES ANY CUSTOMIZED DELIVERABLE IN A MANNER NOT INSTRUCTED BY ZENDESK. ZENDESK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT SUBSCRIBER’S OR ANY THIRD PARTY’S ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE CUSTOMIZED DELIVERABLE SHALL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT IT WILL MEET ANY PARTICULAR CRITERIA OF PERFORMANCE OR QUALITY. ZENDESK EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES REGARDING CUSTOMIZED DELIVERABLE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, COMPATIBILITY, SECURITY OR ACCURACY. FURTHER, ZENDESK EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPPORT OR MAINTAIN CUSTOMIZED DELIVERABLE AND WILL NOT DO SO UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED BY THE PARTIES. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY AND LIABILITY IS EXPRESSLY MADE IN ADDITION TO ANY DISCLAIMERS MADE BY ZENDESK OR ITS AFFILIATES UNDER THE TERMS OF SERVICE WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES AS APPLICABLE TO SUBSCRIBER AND ANY THIRD PARTY’S USE OF THE SERVICES. (c) THESE DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE EXPRESS WARRANTY AND LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH ABOVE FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. 7.3. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) WILL EITHER PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THEIR AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST SALES OR BUSINESS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER LOSS INCURRED BY THE OTHER PARTY OR SUCH THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE CONSULTING SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OR COULD HAVE FORESEEN SUCH DAMAGES. 7.4. EACH PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CONSULTING SERVICES, SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY SUBSCRIBER PRIOR TO THE FIRST EVENT OR OCCURRENCE GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THIS SECTION 7.4 IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND LIMIT POTENTIAL LIABILITY GIVEN THE FEES, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IF ZENDESK WERE TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER LIABILITY OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH HEREIN. ZENDESK HAS RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO PROVIDE SUBSCRIBER THE CONSULTING SERVICES PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT. 7.5. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. IN THESE JURISDICTIONS, EACH PARTY’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 8. Indemnification. 8.1 Zendesk will indemnify and hold Subscriber harmless from and against any claim against Subscriber alleging that any Work Made For Hire (as defined below) infringes or misappropriates a third party’s valid patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret (an “IP Claim”). Zendesk will, at its expense, defend such IP Claim and pay damages finally awarded against Subscriber in connection therewith, including the reasonable fees and expenses of the attorneys engaged by Zendesk for such defense, provided that (a) Subscriber promptly notifies Zendesk of the threat or notice of such IP Claim; (b) Zendesk will have the sole and exclusive control and authority to select defense attorneys, defend and/or settle any such IP Claim; and (c) Subscriber fully cooperates with Zendesk in connection therewith. Zendesk will have no liability or obligation under this Section 8 with respect to any IP Claim if such claim is caused in whole or in part by (i) compliance with designs, data, instructions or specifications provided by Subscriber; (ii) modification of the Work Made For Hire by anyone other than Zendesk; or (iii) the combination, operation or use of the Work Made For Hire with other hardware or software where the Work Made For Hire would not by itself be infringing. 8.2 Subscriber will indemnify and hold Zendesk harmless from and against any claim against Zendesk arising from or related to Subscriber’s breach of this Agreement, provided that (a) Zendesk promptly notifies Subscriber of the threat or notice of such claim; (b) Subscriber will have the sole and exclusive control and authority to select defense attorneys, defend and/or settle any such Zendesk Indemnity Claim; and (c) Zendesk fully cooperates with Subscriber in connection therewith. Subscriber will have no liability or obligation under this Section 8 with respect to any Zendesk Indemnity Claim to the extent such Zendesk Indemnity Claim is caused by Subscriber’s use of any deliverable provided by Zendesk in compliance with instructions provided by Zendesk. 9. Confidentiality. 9.1. For the purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means all information disclosed by Zendesk to Subscriber or by Subscriber to Zendesk which is in tangible form and labeled “confidential” (or with a similar legend) or which a reasonable person would understand to be confidential given the nature of the information and circumstances of disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include information that (a) was already known to the receiving party at the time of disclosure by the disclosing party; (b) was or is obtained by the receiving party by a third party not known by the receiving party to be under an obligation of confidentiality with respect to such information; (c) is or becomes generally available to the public other than by violation of these Terms; (d) was or is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information; or (e) constitutes Subscriber’s Service Data (as that term is defined in the Terms of Service), the use, protection and disclosure of which is governed exclusively by the Terms of Service. 9.2. Subject to the express permissions of this Agreement, Zendesk and Subscriber will protect each other’s Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access or disclosure in the same manner as each protects its own Confidential Information, but with no less than reasonable care. Except as otherwise expressly permitted pursuant to this Agreement, each Party may use the other Party’s Confidential Information solely to exercise its respective rights and perform its respective obligations under this Agreement and shall disclose such Confidential Information solely to those of its Personnel who have a need to know such Confidential Information for such purposes and who are bound to maintain the confidentiality of, and not misuse, such Confidential Information. 9.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall not prevent the party receiving Confidential Information from disclosing such Confidential Information to the extent required by a judicial order or other legal obligation, provided that, in such event, the receiving party shall promptly notify the disclosing party of such requirement to allow intervention (and shall cooperate with the disclosing party at the disclosing party’s expense) to contest or minimize the scope of the disclosure (including application for a protective order). 9.4. The Parties acknowledge that any unpermitted disclosure of a party’s Confidential Information is likely to cause the disclosing party irreparable harm for which its remedies at law would be inadequate. Accordingly, each Party (as the receiving party) acknowledges and agrees that the Party disclosing Confidential Information will be entitled, in addition to any other remedies available to it at law or in equity, to the issuance of injunctive relief, without bond, enjoining any breach or threatened breach of the receiving party’s obligations hereunder with respect to the Confidential Information of the disclosing party, and such further relief as any court of competent jurisdiction may deem just and proper. 9.5. Upon termination of this Agreement or a request by a disclosing party, each party, as a receiving party of Confidential Information, will return to the disclosing party any and all copies of the material containing the other party’s Confidential Information, or any portion thereof, in the possession of the receiving party, except for information necessary to implement the objectives of this Agreement after its termination. 10. Rights to Deliverables; Ownership. 10.1. The Parties hereby agree that the specified Consulting Services to be completed pursuant to any SOW primarily involve the configuration of Subscriber’s subscription to the Service and integration of Subscriber data with and into the Service using Pre-existing Technology, Developed Technology, and/or Generic Components (each as defined below). Unless otherwise expressly specified in a SOW, no deliverable provided in connection with the Consulting Services provided pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute a “Work Made For Hire” under this Agreement. In the event that any such deliverable is held to be a Work Made For Hire, Subscriber hereby assigns to Zendesk all right title and interest therein or to the extent such assignment is not permitted or effective, hereby grants to Zendesk a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully-paid, sub-licensable (through multiple layers), assignable license to any such deliverable. Additionally, Zendesk shall have a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully-paid, sub-licensable (through multiple layers), assignable license to incorporate into the Pre-existing Technology, Developed Technology, and/or Generic Components or otherwise use any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or other feedback Zendesk receives from Subscriber. Subject to Section 10.2, Subscriber and Zendesk agree that Subscriber shall retain all right, title and interest in any deliverable expressly stated in an SOW to be a “Work Made for Hire.” 10.2. Without limiting the foregoing, Zendesk and its licensors reserve and retain ownership to all Preexisting Technology, Developed Technology and Generic Components (each as defined below), and Zendesk hereby grants to Subscriber a non-exclusive, fully paid, limited license to use Preexisting Technology, Developed Technology and Generic Components solely in connection with Subscriber’s use of the Service. “Preexisting Technology” means all of Zendesk’s inventions (including those of Zendesk’s Affiliates) (whether or not patentable), works of authorship, designs, know-how, ideas, concepts, information and tools in existence prior to the commencement of the Consulting Services. “Developed Technology” means ideas (whether or not patentable) know-how, technical data, techniques, concepts, information or tools, and all associated intellectual property rights thereto developed by Zendesk and its Affiliates or their Personnel in connection with providing Consulting Services pursuant to this Agreement that derive from, improve, enhance or modify Zendesk’s Preexisting Technology. “Generic Components” means all inventions (whether or not patentable), works of authorship, designs, know-how, ideas, information and tools, including without limitation software and programming tools developed by Zendesk and its Affiliates or their Personnel in connection with providing Consulting Services generally to support Zendesk’s product and/or service offerings (including, without limitation the Service) and which can be so used without use of Subscriber’s Confidential Information. 11. Entire Agreement. This Agreement thereto constitutes the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement among the Parties with respect to the Consulting Services to be provided pursuant to this Agreement (to be supplemented by the SOW), and supersedes all prior negotiations, understandings or agreements (oral or written), between the Parties concerning its subject matter. Zendesk’s failure to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of that provision or of any other provision of the Terms. Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties agree and acknowledge that this Agreement shall have no effect on the rights and obligations of the Parties pursuant to the Terms of Service (or the Agreement as defined therein). Zendesk may amend this Agreement from time to time, in which case the new Agreement will supersede prior versions. Zendesk will notify Subscriber not less than ten (10) days prior to the effective date of any such amendment and Subscriber’s continued use of the Consulting Services following the effective date of any such amendment may be relied upon by Zendesk as Subscriber’s consent to any such amendment. 12. Waiver. The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period will not be construed as a waiver of such rights. No change, modification or waiver to this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by both Parties. 13. Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement will, for any reason, be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will be interpreted as closely as possible so as not affect any other provision of this Agreement, and such provision will further be modified by said court to permit its enforcement to the maximum extent permitted by law. 14. Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflicts of law provisions thereof. Exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any action arising under this Agreement is in the federal courts located in San Francisco, California, and both Parties hereby consent to such jurisdiction and venue for this purpose.

This Agreement does not grant any license to any of Zendesk’s, or any Subcontractor’s software or products (including, without limitation, the Service), except as specifically provided pursuant to Section 10. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e3.8. In the event that Subscriber seeks to change the scope of Consulting Services to be provided under any SOW (including but not limited to any changes to the project schedule described in the SOW), Subscriber shall discuss such proposed changes with Zendesk. If Zendesk elects to perform such changes to the Consulting Services, the Parties shall work together in good faith to execute a Change Order. Zendesk shall be entitled to an adjustment in Fees pursuant to the changes reflected in the Change Order. Zendesk shall not be obligated to perform any differing or additional Consulting Services unless the Parties have mutually agreed upon a written Change Order.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e3.9. For SOWs that are deliverable/milestone based, upon delivery of all deliverables or completion of all milestones detailed in the SOW, Zendesk shall provide Subscriber with written notice (“Completion Notice”). Subscriber shall then have five (5) days after the date of the Completion Notice to provide Zendesk with written notice describing any deliverables that have not been provided or milestones not met. The SOW shall be deemed complete absent Subscriber\\u0026#8217;s timely written notice of any deliverables or milestones not having been met. For the avoidance of doubt, a Completion Notice shall not be necessary for SOWs that are Time and Materials based.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e4. Fees; Payment Terms. \\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e4.1. Subscriber will pay Zendesk the fees to provide the Consulting Services as detailed or described in a SOW (the “Fees”). Unless agreed upon otherwise in the applicable SOW, Zendesk shall invoice Subscriber for the Services provided on a monthly basis. All Fees are due and payable upon date of invoice, except for Fees that Subscriber disputes in good faith for reasons articulated in writing by Subscriber within thirty (30) days after receiving such invoice. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e4.2. All Consulting Services will be provided on either a time and materials or fixed-fee basis, as indicated in the applicable SOW. Each SOW providing for time and materials based Fees will contain a detailed estimate of such time and materials necessary for performance of Consulting Services (“T\\u0026amp;M Estimate”). Zendesk will make a commercially reasonable effort to provide such Consulting Services within such T\\u0026amp;M Estimate, up to the number of hours agreed to by the Parties. Zendesk will make a reasonable effort to notify Subscriber as soon as practicable if it appears that T\\u0026amp;M Estimate may be exceeded. Upon receiving such amended T\\u0026amp;M Estimate, Subscriber will assess, and accept or reject the amended T\\u0026amp;M Estimate. Unless Subscriber rejects such amended T\\u0026amp;M Estimate within five (5) days of delivery, such amended T\\u0026amp;M Estimate shall be deemed accepted by Subscriber and Subscriber shall be liable for all Fees associated with Consulting Services delivered in reliance on such amended T\\u0026amp;M Estimate. Any amended T\\u0026amp;M Estimate which is or is deemed accepted by Subscriber shall be deemed a Change Order.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e4.3. The performance of Consulting Services may be subject to a retainer to be paid in advance by Subscriber upon execution and delivery of the SOW. Such retainer will be applied against Fees which become payable by Subscriber pursuant to this Agreement. Zendesk may refuse to perform Consulting Services unless and until such retainer is paid to Zendesk. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e4.4. In addition to any and all Fees, Subscriber will reimburse Zendesk for any reasonable expenses for travel, lodging, communications, shipping charges and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Zendesk in connection with providing the Consulting Services (“Expenses”). Zendesk will provide reasonable documentation for all Expenses as requested by Subscriber. Subscriber shall reimburse Zendesk for Expenses within thirty (30) days of submission of the Expenses to Subscriber by Zendesk.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e4.5. Any unpaid Fees or Expenses will become overdue thirty (30) days after payment is due and shall be subject to a late fee of one and one and a half percent (1.5%) per month for each month where payment is not received. Subscriber’s failure to make timely payments under this Agreement may be considered by Zendesk a material breach of this Agreement by Subscriber, which may result in suspension of Consulting Services by Zendesk. Subscriber will be responsible for any and all taxes levied on transactions under this Agreement other than taxes based on Zendesk’s income.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e5. Relationship of the Parties\\u003c/strong\\u003e. Zendesk is an independent contractor and will maintain complete control of and responsibility for its Personnel, methods and operations. Zendesk at no time will hold itself out as an agent, subsidiary or affiliate of Subscriber for any purpose, including reporting to any government authority. This Agreement will not be construed so as to create a partnership, other joint venture or undertaking, or any agency relationship between the Parties, and neither Party shall become liable for any representation, act or omission of the other Party or have the authority to contractually bind the other Party. Any Fees, Expenses or other amounts paid by Subscriber to Zendesk hereunder shall not be considered salary for pension or wage tax purposes and neither Zendesk nor its Personnel will be entitled to any fringe benefits, including sick or vacation pay, or other supplemental benefits of Subscriber, unless otherwise required by law. Subscriber shall not be responsible for deducting or withholding from Fees or Expenses paid under this Agreement any taxes, unemployment, social security or other such expense unless otherwise required by law.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e6. Term and Termination\\u003c/strong\\u003e. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e6.1. This Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will remain effective for as long as any SOW is in effect among the Parties, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Section 6. Any termination of this Agreement shall terminate any then-effective SOW.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e6.2. This Agreement may be terminated by either party with or without cause upon no less than thirty (30) days advance written notice to the other Party.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e6.3. Either Party may terminate this Agreement if the other Party materially breaches any obligation hereunder, provided the terminating Party has provided notice of such breach to the other Party and an opportunity to cure such breach during a period of not less than thirty (30) days following such notice. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e6.4. Upon termination of this Agreement, Zendesk will immediately cease performing any Consulting Services, and Subscriber will pay Zendesk any Fees not yet paid for all Consulting Services provided pursuant to any SOW on or prior to such termination on a prorated basis (or on such other basis as the Parties will mutually agree) and reimburse Expenses incurred on or prior to termination not yet reimbursed. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e6.5. Sections 4 through 16 of this Agreement will survive any termination of the Agreement to the extent necessary to implement their objectives. Termination of this Agreement will be without prejudice to other rights or remedies of any Party under this Agreement or applicable law, including, without limitation, any remedies for a breach of this Agreement prior to such termination. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e7. Warranties, Limitation of Liability. \\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e7.1.

ZENDESK SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE, AT LAW OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY CUSTOMIZED DELIVERABLE DESPITE ANY OTHER WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES, IN THE EVENT THAT SUBSCRIBER MODIFIES ANY CUSTOMIZED DELIVERABLE IN A MANNER NOT INSTRUCTED BY ZENDESK. ZENDESK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT SUBSCRIBER’S OR ANY THIRD PARTY’S ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE CUSTOMIZED DELIVERABLE SHALL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT IT WILL MEET ANY PARTICULAR CRITERIA OF PERFORMANCE OR QUALITY.

EACH PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CONSULTING SERVICES, SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY SUBSCRIBER PRIOR TO THE FIRST EVENT OR OCCURRENCE GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THIS SECTION 7.4 IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND LIMIT POTENTIAL LIABILITY GIVEN THE FEES, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IF ZENDESK WERE TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER LIABILITY OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH HEREIN. ZENDESK HAS RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO PROVIDE SUBSCRIBER THE CONSULTING SERVICES PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e7.5. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply.

Zendesk will, at its expense, defend such IP Claim and pay damages finally awarded against Subscriber in connection therewith, including the reasonable fees and expenses of the attorneys engaged by Zendesk for such defense, provided that (a) Subscriber promptly notifies Zendesk of the threat or notice of such IP Claim; (b) Zendesk will have the sole and exclusive control and authority to select defense attorneys, defend and/or settle any such IP Claim; and (c) Subscriber fully cooperates with Zendesk in connection therewith. Zendesk will have no liability or obligation under this Section 8 with respect to any IP Claim if such claim is caused in whole or in part by (i) compliance with designs, data, instructions or specifications provided by Subscriber; (ii) modification of the Work Made For Hire by anyone other than Zendesk; or (iii) the combination, operation or use of the Work Made For Hire with other hardware or software where the Work Made For Hire would not by itself be infringing. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e8.2 Subscriber will indemnify and hold Zendesk harmless from and against any claim against Zendesk arising from or related to Subscriber’s breach of this Agreement, provided that (a) Zendesk promptly notifies Subscriber of the threat or notice of such claim; (b) Subscriber will have the sole and exclusive control and authority to select defense attorneys, defend and/or settle any such Zendesk Indemnity Claim; and (c) Zendesk fully cooperates with Subscriber in connection therewith.

Confidentiality\\u003c/strong\\u003e.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e9.1. For the purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means all information disclosed by Zendesk to Subscriber or by Subscriber to Zendesk which is in tangible form and labeled “confidential” (or with a similar legend) or which a reasonable person would understand to be confidential given the nature of the information and circumstances of disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include information that (a) was already known to the receiving party at the time of disclosure by the disclosing party; (b) was or is obtained by the receiving party by a third party not known by the receiving party to be under an obligation of confidentiality with respect to such information; (c) is or becomes generally available to the public other than by violation of these Terms; (d) was or is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information; or (e) constitutes Subscriber’s Service Data (as that term is defined in the Terms of Service), the use, protection and disclosure of which is governed exclusively by the Terms of Service. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e9.2. Subject to the express permissions of this Agreement, Zendesk and Subscriber will protect each other’s Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access or disclosure in the same manner as each protects its own Confidential Information, but with no less than reasonable care. Except as otherwise expressly permitted pursuant to this Agreement, each Party may use the other Party’s Confidential Information solely to exercise its respective rights and perform its respective obligations under this Agreement and shall disclose such Confidential Information solely to those of its Personnel who have a need to know such Confidential Information for such purposes and who are bound to maintain the confidentiality of, and not misuse, such Confidential Information.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e9.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall not prevent the party receiving Confidential Information from disclosing such Confidential Information to the extent required by a judicial order or other legal obligation, provided that, in such event, the receiving party shall promptly notify the disclosing party of such requirement to allow intervention (and shall cooperate with the disclosing party at the disclosing party’s expense) to contest or minimize the scope of the disclosure (including application for a protective order).\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e9.4. The Parties acknowledge that any unpermitted disclosure of a party’s Confidential Information is likely to cause the disclosing party irreparable harm for which its remedies at law would be inadequate. Accordingly, each Party (as the receiving party) acknowledges and agrees that the Party disclosing Confidential Information will be entitled, in addition to any other remedies available to it at law or in equity, to the issuance of injunctive relief, without bond, enjoining any breach or threatened breach of the receiving party’s obligations hereunder with respect to the Confidential Information of the disclosing party, and such further relief as any court of competent jurisdiction may deem just and proper.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e9.5. Upon termination of this Agreement or a request by a disclosing party, each party, as a receiving party of Confidential Information, will return to the disclosing party any and all copies of the material containing the other party’s Confidential Information, or any portion thereof, in the possession of the receiving party, except for information necessary to implement the objectives of this Agreement after its termination.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e10. Rights to Deliverables; Ownership. \\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e10.1. The Parties hereby agree that the specified Consulting Services to be completed pursuant to any SOW primarily involve the configuration of Subscriber’s subscription to the Service and integration of Subscriber data with and into the Service using Pre-existing Technology, Developed Technology, and/or Generic Components (each as defined below). Unless otherwise expressly specified in a SOW, no deliverable provided in connection with the Consulting Services provided pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute a “Work Made For Hire” under this Agreement. In the event that any such deliverable is held to be a Work Made For Hire, Subscriber hereby assigns to Zendesk all right title and interest therein or to the extent such assignment is not permitted or effective, hereby grants to Zendesk a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully-paid, sub-licensable (through multiple layers), assignable license to any such deliverable. Additionally, Zendesk shall have a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully-paid, sub-licensable (through multiple layers), assignable license to incorporate into the Pre-existing Technology, Developed Technology, and/or Generic Components or otherwise use any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or other feedback Zendesk receives from Subscriber. Subject to Section 10.2, Subscriber and Zendesk agree that Subscriber shall retain all right, title and interest in any deliverable expressly stated in an SOW to be a “Work Made for Hire.”\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e10.2. Without limiting the foregoing, Zendesk and its licensors reserve and retain ownership to all Preexisting Technology, Developed Technology and Generic Components (each as defined below), and Zendesk hereby grants to Subscriber a non-exclusive, fully paid, limited license to use Preexisting Technology, Developed Technology and Generic Components solely in connection with Subscriber’s use of the Service. “Preexisting Technology” means all of Zendesk’s inventions (including those of Zendesk’s Affiliates) (whether or not patentable), works of authorship, designs, know-how, ideas, concepts, information and tools in existence prior to the commencement of the Consulting Services. “Developed Technology” means ideas (whether or not patentable) know-how, technical data, techniques, concepts, information or tools, and all associated intellectual property rights thereto developed by Zendesk and its Affiliates or their Personnel in connection with providing Consulting Services pursuant to this Agreement that derive from, improve, enhance or modify Zendesk’s Preexisting Technology. “Generic Components” means all inventions (whether or not patentable), works of authorship, designs, know-how, ideas, information and tools, including without limitation software and programming tools developed by Zendesk and its Affiliates or their Personnel in connection with providing Consulting Services generally to support Zendesk’s product and/or service offerings (including, without limitation the Service) and which can be so used without use of Subscriber’s Confidential Information.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e11. Entire Agreement.\\u003c/strong\\u003e This Agreement thereto constitutes the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement among the Parties with respect to the Consulting Services to be provided pursuant to this Agreement (to be supplemented by the SOW), and supersedes all prior negotiations, understandings or agreements (oral or written), between the Parties concerning its subject matter. Zendesk’s failure to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of that provision or of any other provision of the Terms. Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties agree and acknowledge that this Agreement shall have no effect on the rights and obligations of the Parties pursuant to the Terms of Service (or the Agreement as defined therein). Zendesk may amend this Agreement from time to time, in which case the new Agreement will supersede prior versions. Zendesk will notify Subscriber not less than ten (10) days prior to the effective date of any such amendment and Subscriber’s continued use of the Consulting Services following the effective date of any such amendment may be relied upon by Zendesk as Subscriber’s consent to any such amendment.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e12. Waiver.\\u003c/strong\\u003e The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period will not be construed as a waiver of such rights. No change, modification or waiver to this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by both Parties. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e13. Severability.\\u003c/strong\\u003e In the event that any provision of this Agreement will, for any reason, be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will be interpreted as closely as possible so as not affect any other provision of this Agreement, and such provision will further be modified by said court to permit its enforcement to the maximum extent permitted by law.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e14. Governing Law.\\u003c/strong\\u003e This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflicts of law provisions thereof. Exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any action arising under this Agreement is in the federal courts located in San Francisco, California, and both Parties hereby consent to such jurisdiction and venue for this purpose. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/div\\u003e\\n\"},\"preview\":false,\"id\":139391,},,\"__namespaces\":,\"footer\":,\"formGlobal\":,\"contactFormModal\":,\"legal\":},\"__N_SSG\":true},,\"query\":,,,\"isFallback\":false,\"gsp\":true,\"appGip\":true,,\"locales\":[\"us\",\"au\",\"br\",\"de\",\"dk\",\"es\",\"fr\",\"gb\",\"hk\",\"it\",\"in\",\"jp\",\"kr\",\"mx\",\"nl\",\"se\",\"sg\",\"tw\",\"th\"],,\"domainLocales\":[,,,,,,,,,,,],\"scriptLoader\":[]}",

As a user You can accept or decline the use of cookies through a functionality built into most web browsers. Users who disable their web browsers ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Site, but will not be able to access or take advantage of the Service. Clear Gifs (a.k.a Web Beacons) Our third-party tracking utility company employs a software technology called clear gifs that helps us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a users computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers personal information, and use them in our HTML-based emails to learn which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and our marketing campaigns. If You would like to opt-out of these emails, please follow the unsubscribe instructions within our marketing emails. Log Files As is true with most web sites, Zendesk gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes internet protocol addresses as well as browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. Occasionally We may connect personal information to data gathered in our log files, as necessary to improve the Service to individual customers. Otherwise We mostly use this information with no connection to individual users, to analyze trends, administer the Site, or track usage of various features within the Site. Links to Other Sites Our Site contains links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by Zendesk. Please be aware that We do not determine and We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other sites. We encourage You to be aware when you leave our Site, and read the privacy statements of other websites linked to our Site. This Policy applies only to information collected by this Site. Public Forums Our Site offers publicly-accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information You provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at privacy@zendesk. In some cases, We may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case We will let You know if We are unable to do so and why. Customer Testimonials/Comments/Reviews From time to time, We post customer testimonials on the Site which may contain personal information. We do obtain the customers consent to post their names along with their testimonials. Information Sharing Except as described in this Policy, Zendesk will not give, sell, rent or loan any personal information to any third party. We may disclose such information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. Zendesk may also provide non-personal, summary or group statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personal information. Protection of Information Zendesk is committed to ensuring the security of your personal information. We take every precaution to protect the confidentiality and security of the personal information placed on the Site or used within the Service, by employing technological, physical and administrative security safeguards, such as firewalls and carefully-developed security procedures. For example, when You enter sensitive information (such as login credentials and all your activity on our Service platform) We encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). These technologies, procedures and other measures help ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to You and to those You authorized access. Safe Harbor Data Privacy Notice for European Union Web site visitors and clients Zendesk complies with the US  EU and US  Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks for protecting the privacy of data flowing from the EU and Switzerland to the US, as set forth by the US Department of Commerce. Below We outline our practices for implementing the Safe Harbor Principles, including the type of information to which this notice applies, how We collect, use and retain personal information from EU member countries and Switzerland, and the choices individuals have regarding our use of, and their ability to correct, their personal information. Generally We frequently enter agreements with our EU customers to provide them our Service, which includes the processing of information relating to our customers’ customers. In providing our Service We do not own, control or direct the use of the information stored or processed on our platform at the direction of our customers, and in fact We are largely unaware of what information is actually being stored on our platform and only access such information as authorized by our customers or as required by law. Only You or your customers are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such information. As such, We are only the data processors and not the data controllers of the information on our platform for purposes of the EU Directive on Data Protection (Directive 95/45/EC) and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection. Our EU or Swiss customers, who control their customer data and send it to Zendesk for processing, are the controllers of that data and are responsible for compliance with the Directive. As the processors of personal information on behalf of our European customers, we follow their instructions with respect to the information they control. In doing so We implement appropriate technical, physical and administrative measures against unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of, or damage to, personal information. Notice Where Zendesk collects personal information directly from its EU customers, it informs them about the purpose for which it collects and uses their personal information, the choices they have to limit the use of personal information about them, and how to contact Zendesk. Beyond that, We have no direct relationship with our customers customers whose personal data We processes. Zendesks customers are responsible for complying with the Directive and relevant data protection legislation in the relevant EU member state before sending personal data to Zendesk for processing. We work with our customers to help them provide notice to their customers concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected. Choice We process and store information on behalf of our customers. If You are a customer of one of our customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers that uses our Service, please contact that customer directly. If You are our customer and would like to opt-out of getting communications from Zendesk please contact us at privacy@zendesk or follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each marketing email. Requests to opt-out of transfers to our third-party vendors will also be considered, but limitations on data sharing may make it difficult or impossible to provide the Service. Onwards Transfer We may transfer personal information to our third-party vendors that help us provide the Service, subject to appropriate confidentiality restrictions. Such transfers are limited to the purposes for which personal data has been transferred to us from our customers. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this Policy regarding notice and choice, and the service agreements with our customers. Otherwise We may also share personal information as is required or permitted by law. Access and Review of Data Residents of the EU and Switzerland whose personal information Zendesk controls may request access and the opportunity to correct, amend, or delete that information. If You are our customer and would like to gain access to, or request deletion of information We have collected as data controllers, please contact us at privacy@zendesk. We will respond to such queries within 30 business days. Zendesk has no direct relationship with its customers customers whose personal data it processes. An individual seeking access, or who would like to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the Zendesk customer with whom such individual interacts (the data controller). At the request of our customers We remove data within 30 business days. Data Retention Zendesk will retain personal information We process on behalf of our customers for as long as needed to provide Service to our customers, subject to our compliance with this Policy.

This Global Anti-Corruption Policy (“Policy”) applies to Zendesk, Inc. and to all its divisions and subsidiaries (referred to collectively in this Policy as “We” or “Zendesk”). We strictly prohibit engaging in or tolerating bribery or any other form of corruption. We’ve adopted this Policy to make sure you can identify and avoid situations that may lead to a violation of this Policy and damage to Zendesk’s property, reputation, or other interests. It’s impossible to predict and describe every situation, so make sure you adopt both the spirit and the letter of this Policy. We also need your help to make sure this Policy is complied with. If you believe that any employee, contractor, or other individual has violated this Policy, you should report this to your manager, Human Resources Department or the Legal Department, as applicable. We strictly prohibit any retaliation against you for making any such report. All employees and contractors of Zendesk must follow this Policy. As discussed more fully below, it also applies to third parties acting on our behalf and for our benefit, including agents and business partners. We believe compliance with this Policy is of utmost importance. You are expected to become familiar and comply with this Policy, to participate in training, and to communicate the values underlying this Policy in your interactions with colleagues and third parties. Payment to Government Officials This Policy strictly prohibits Zendesk and anyone else covered by this Policy from offering, promising or giving anything of value to a Government Official, directly or indirectly, with the intention of influencing him or her in his or her capacity as a Government Official to obtain or retain business or a business advantage. This Policy prohibits an offer or promise of any payment or gift, even if the Government Official rejects the offer, or it fails to bring about the desired outcome. What is “Anything of Value”? Under our Policy the term “anything of value” is broadly defined to include both financial and other non-financial advantages. Things of value include, for example, gifts, entertainment, favors, services, loans and loan guarantees, the use of property or equipment, job offers, transportation, and the payment of expenses or debts. Importantly, there is no “small payment” exception and this Policy prohibits “speed,” “grease” or facilitation payments. Facilitation payments are typically small, unofficial payments made to secure or expedite a routine government action by a government official. They may be common in some other jurisdictions in which we operate, but this does not make them permissible under our Policy. It is permissible, in the context of Zendesk’s business relationship with any Government Official, to incur expenses in connection with the legitimate promotion or demonstration of Zendesk’s services and products. Such expenses are discussed more fully below. Who is a “Government Official”? The term Government Official is broadly defined to include any individual who is an officer or employee of a government or any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof; who holds a legislative, administrative or judicial position of any kind, whether appointed or elected; who exercises a public function; or who is an official or agent of a public international organization (such as the United Nations, the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund). Government Official also includes any political party, official of a political party, and any candidate for political office. In addition, under our Policy, Government Official includes any executive, officer, agent or employee of a government-owned or government-controlled business (such as a state-owned bank or utility, a sovereign wealth fund, or a public university). Finally, under our Policy, Government Official includes any person who is acting in an official capacity for the entities described above, including a private consultant who also holds a position with, or acts on behalf of, a government or with a public international organization, or with an enterprise owned or controlled by a government. What is an “Improper Advantage”? An “improper advantage” as used in this Policy could arise in a multitude of situations and includes, but is not limited to, attempts to win a contract or business. We prohibit payments to secure any business advantage. By way of example, attempts to secure improper advantages may involve efforts to: secure a government contract;avoid taxes or fines;obtain confidential information about business opportunities, bids or the activities of competitors;obtain a permit or license, other than through the payment of standard application fees;influence implementation of a law that is beneficial to our business or to influence the repeal of a law that is adverse to our business; orobtain relief or exemption from or otherwise affect government controls or regulations or their application. Payment to Other Individuals We also strictly prohibit offering, promising or giving anything of value to other individuals (i.e. non-Government Officials), directly or indirectly, with the intention of inducing that person or entity to improperly perform a function or activity (such as his, her or its work) or to reward a person or entity for having improperly performed a function or activity. This Policy prohibits an offer or promise of a payment or gift, even if the individual or entity rejects the offer, or it fails to bring about the desired outcome. It is permissible, however, in the context of our business relationship with private persons or entities, to incur reasonable, proportionate and good faith expenses in connection with the promotion of our product and in relation to our corporate hospitality. Such expenses are discussed more fully below. Solicitation, Extortion, Health and Safety You may not make a payment or gift to a Government Official or other individual even where he or she requests or demands you to do it or threatens adverse action against you or Zendesk unless a payment is made. If you are forced to make a payment to protect your safety or the safety or someone else, you may do so, but it must be immediately reported to the Legal Department and must be accurately recorded in Zendesk’s books and records to reflect the amount and purpose of the payment. If at all practicable, contact should be made with the Legal Department before such a payment is made. If prior consultation is not practicable, the fact of payment and the circumstances should be reported as soon as possible. Books, Records and Accounting Zendesk is required to maintain books and accounting records that accurately reflect all transactions in reasonable detail. These record-keeping requirements apply to all payments, not merely those that would be material in the traditional financialsense. Officers, directors, employees, contractors and third parties are prohibited from manipulating books or records in an effort to mask transactions, either by characterizing them in some oblique way, or by omitting them from Zendesk’s books or records entirely. Accordingly, no undisclosed or unrecorded accounts may be maintained for any purpose. Penalties Companies whose employees are found to have violated applicable anti-corruption laws may face harsh penalties, including significant fines. In addition, such a company may be precluded from doing business with government entities in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. Individuals who violate the law may be subject to imprisonment. Violation of this Policy or applicable anti-corruption laws will result in discipline by Zendesk, up to and including termination of employment, as appropriate. Meals, Entertainment and Gifts Meals, entertainment, and gifts can be valuable business development tools and Zendesk encourages you to use them, provided their use is in our best interests and in compliance with applicable laws and this Policy. It is permissible under this Policy to incur certain expenses for a Government Official that are directly related to the promotion or demonstration of Zendesk’s products. In addition, this Policy allows reasonable meal and entertainment expenses for other individuals in the context of establishing and maintaining appropriate business relationships. As discussed more fully below, any such expenses must be reasonable and appropriate. In all interactions – both in the public and private sector – meals, entertainment and gifts may not be used to exert improper influence. Even reasonable expenses are prohibited if they are for the purpose of improperly influencing a business or regulatory decision, or if they are intended to reward a person for having improperly performed a function or activity. Finally, a benefit (even if considered reasonable under this Policy) may not be conveyed if the recipient is not permitted to accept it pursuant to applicable law or a policy enforced by such recipient’s organization. All promotional expenses must be fully documented, supported by original receipts, properly approved, and submitted in accordance with the following procedures, as well as any other applicable Zendesk procedures for expense approval and authorization, including the Zendesk Travel and Expense Reimbursement Policy. Government Officials Meals, entertainment, and gifts represent “things of value” under this Policy and may never be provided to a Government Official for the purpose of influencing a Government Official to obtain or retain business or to secure a business advantage. Lavish meals, extravagant entertainment or cash gifts are never appropriate for Government Officials or other individuals. Meal and related entertainment expenses for a Government Official may be incurred only if all of the following conditions are met: it is not made with the intention of influencing a third party to obtain or retain business or a business advantage or to award the provision or retention of business or a business advantage or in explicit exchange for favors or benefits;the meal or entertainment occurs in connection with substantive business meetings, occurs in the same general location as such meetings, and is attended by appropriate Zendesk representatives;the value of the meal or entertainment expenses are nominal and in accordance with the Zendesk Travel and Expense Reimbursement Policy;the entertainment or meals are permitted under applicable laws (including local laws), as well as any rules or regulations of the recipient’s employer;the expenses are properly recorded and approved in accordance with our policies;it is appropriate in the circumstances; andit is given openly and not secretly. Gifts to a Government Official should only be given as a goodwill gesture, and gifts may never be provided for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or any improper advantage. Cash (or cash equivalent) gifts are never permitted. Any items provided to a Government Official may be provided only if the following conditions are met: the item is of nominal value bearing the Zendesk and/or our partner’s logo;the gift is permitted under applicable laws (including local laws), as well as any rules or regulations of the recipient’s employer;the expenses involved are properly recorded and approved in accordance with our policies; andit is given in Zendesk’s name and not your name. Gifts that do not meet all of the foregoing criteria should be reviewed and approved in advance by the Legal Department. Other Individuals In the private sector, meals, entertainment and gifts may never be provided if the purpose is to improperly influence a person in the performance of his or her duties, or to reward improper performance of his or her duties. Reasonable, proportionate meals, entertainment or gifts provided in good faith in the context of interactions with these individuals is permitted for purposes of establishing and maintaining business relationships. Meal and related entertainment expenses for individuals other than Government Officials may only be provided if all of the following conditions are met: it is not made with the intention of influencing a third party to obtain or retain business or a business advantage or to award the provision or retention of business or a business advantage or in explicit exchange for favors or benefits;the meal or entertainment occurs in connection with substantive discussions of the Zendesk’s business and is attended by appropriate Zendesk employees with responsibilities for the matter being discussed;the entertainment or meals are permitted under applicable laws (including local laws), as well as any rules or regulations of the recipient’s employer;the expenses are properly recorded and approved in accordance with Zendesk policies; andthe value of the meal or entertainment expenses is appropriate and in accordance with Zendesk’s Travel and Expense Reimbursement Policy;it is appropriate in the circumstances; andit is given openly and not secretly. Gifts to other individuals (i.e. non-Government Officials) should only be given as a goodwill gesture, and gifts may never be provided for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or any improper advantage. Cash (or cash equivalent) gifts are never permitted. Any items provided to individuals other than Government Officials may be provided only if the following conditions are met: unless the gift is approved in accordance with Zendesk’s Gift Policy, the gift will not cause the aggregate value of the all gifts to such individual during one month to exceed $150;the gift is permitted under applicable laws (including local laws), as well as any rules or regulations of the recipient’s employer;the expenses involved are properly recorded and approved in accordance with our policies; andit is given in Zendesk’s name and not your name. Gifts that do not meet all of the foregoing criteria should be reviewed and approved in advance by the Legal Department. From time to time Zendesk sponsors promotional and educational events. You must take particular care in inviting a business person to these events if there is a business decision expected or pending with the person’s employer that could benefit Zendesk. If you have any questions regarding the appropriateness of extending an invitation to a promotional or educational event, you should contact the Legal Department. Gifts may not be accepted by Zendesk employees by third parties if such gift was provided with the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or influence any decision in favor of the third party for an improper advange. In no case may Zendesk employees receive any income or material gain from individuals or organizations outside of Zendesk for services rendered while performing a role for Zendesk, with the exception of nominal gifts such as a holiday gift basket. Travel At times, Zendesk may be requested to pay the travel and lodging expenses of a Government Official or other individual in connection with trips to meet with Zendesk representatives, or attend seminars sponsored by Zendesk. Reimbursements by Zendesk for such expenses on behalf of a Government Official or other individual require the prior written approval of the Legal Department. Reimbursement is generally acceptable where the expenses relate to reasonable and bona fide travel, accommodation and meal expenses in connection with a contract between Zendesk and the applicable government, agency or other entity that such individual represents, or the demonstration of Zendesk capabilities relating to proposed business with such government, agency or other entity. Wherever possible, Zendesk should arrange to directly reimburse expenses to the governmental agency or other entity that such individual represents rather than reimburse the individual personally. In no case should reimbursements be made: by cash payment directly to a Government Official or other individual;for expenses relating to family members or other persons accompanying a Government Official or other individual;for expenses relating to destinations that are not directly related to the Zendesk’s facilities, products, or services; orfor travel expenses in excess of those that would likely be incurred by Zendesk employees of equivalent status as the Government Official or other individual if such Zendesk employees were to travel to the same destination. Political Contributions It is Zendesk’s Policy that no Zendesk funds, assets, services, or facilities shall be contributed to any politician, candidate for political office, political party, or political action committee without the prior written approval of Zendesk’s Chief Executive Officer, whether or not the written laws of the relevant country allow such payments. A “political contribution” includes not only monetary contributions, but also payments for fundraising dinners or other material support. All of the following criteria must be met when Zendesk makes a political contribution to a politician, candidate for political office, political party, or political action committee in a foreign country: the payment must be permitted under applicable law; andthe payments are properly recorded and approved in accordance with Zendesk policies, including the approval requirements above. Donations to Charities Charitable donations may be used as a means to conceal improper payments. Even bona fide donations could be construed as an attempt to influence a Government Official or another person. It is our policy that no Zendesk funds, assets, services, or facilities may be contributed to any Charity without the prior written approval of Zendesk’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or General Counsel, whether or not the written laws of the relevant country allow such payments. The following procedures must be observed before making a donation of Zendesk funds, assets, services, or facilitates to a charitable entity, which are in addition to, not in lieu of, any other applicable expense or authorization policy or procedure: the payment must be permitted under applicable law; andthe payments are properly recorded and approved in accordance with Zendesk policies, including the approval requirements above. Relationships with Agents and Business Partners Zendesk Policy strictly prohibits using an agent, consultant, intermediary, or other third party to make a payment or gift that would be prohibited by our Policy if made by Zendesk or its employees. The actions of third parties present particular risks, because in certain circumstances Zendesk and its employees can be held liable for improper payments made by a third party even if Zendesk did not have actual knowledge of the payment. Accordingly, this Policy provides for strict due diligence and controls when dealing with third parties who may interact with a Government Official or other persons or entities for or on behalf of Zendesk. Whenever Zendesk seeks to engage a consultant, agent, representative, subcontractor, or other third party (“Agent”) in a context in which the Agent may interact with a Government Official or otherwise act for or on behalf of Zendesk, due diligence must be performed to ensure that the Agent is a bona fide and legitimate individual or entity; is qualified to perform services for which the Agent will be retained; and maintains standards consistent with the ethical and reputational standards of Zendesk. Diligence should be enhanced if there are red flags of improper activity, such as unusual or excessive payment requests, any refusal or hesitancy by the Agent to promise in writing to abide by Zendesk’s Policy and governing law, or a demand or strong suggestion by a Government Official or other commercial counterparty that a particular Agent should be retained. Agreements with Agents must be in writing and must describe the services to be performed, the basis for compensation of the Agent, the amounts to be paid, and other material terms and conditions of the representation. Payments to an Agent should never be made in cash and should be made to the Agent’s bank account in the country where the services are performed or where the Agent’s offices are located. Payment to other locations must be approved in advance by the Legal Department. Local adaptation In order for this Policy to be effective, it is necessary for it to be applied across Zendesk, taking into consideration the diverse cultural environments in which we may operate and conduct business. This may require certain subsidiaries or offices to adapt certain sections of this Policy to ensure they are fair, appropriate and applicable. No local adaption to this Policy may be undertaken without approval of the Legal Department and, where appropriate, the Board of Directors of Zendesk, Inc. Compliance Officer Zendesk has designated its General Counsel as the Compliance Officer responsible for implementing and providing guidance and interpretation on matters related to this Policy. The Compliance Officer, with assistance from the Legal Department, is also responsible for investigating, or overseeing investigation of, any information or allegations concerning possible violations of anticorruption laws or this Policy. The Compliance Officer will have authority to work with the Zendesk Legal Department and retain and consult with outside legal counsel to assist in carry out his or her duties. You may direct any questions about this Policy or report any suspected noncompliance with the Policy to the Compliance Officer at: Address: General Counsel c/o Legal Department Zendesk, Inc. 1019 Market St. San Francisco, CA 94103 Email: legal@zendesk Champions of customer serviceOur ProductsZendesk for serviceZendesk for salesSunshine PlatformMarketplaceProduct updatesTop FeaturesTicketing systemMessaging & live chatHelp centerVoiceCommunity forumsReporting & analyticsAnswer BotCustomer service softwareTicketing system softwareLive chat softwareKnowledge baseForum softwareHelp desk softwareWorkforce managementResourcesSecurityProduct supportRequest a demoBlogTrainingPartnersWebinarsCustomer StoriesServicesCompanyAbout usNewsroomInvestorsEventsCareersDiversity & InclusionAccessibility PlanSustainabilityContact usSitemapSystem statusZendesk FoundationLegalFavorite ThingsWhat is ZendeskZendesk for EnterpriseZendesk for Small BusinessZendesk for StartupsZendesk BenchmarkGartner CRM Magic QuadrantCustomer Experience TrendsWhat is CRM?CRM software guideJoin our research panelSubscribe to receive news and updates from ZendeskcribeBy checking this box, I agree to Zendesk contacting me with marketing-related communications about Zendesk products, services, and events.

By accepting this Agreement or executing any SOW Customer agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If You are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company, organization or another legal entity (an Entity), You are agreeing to this Agreement for that Entity and representing to Consultant that You have the authority to bind such Entity and its affiliates to these Terms, in which case the term You or Customer or related capitalized terms herein will refer to such Entity and its affiliates. If You do not have such authority, or if You do not agree with this Agreement, You must not agree to be bound by this Agreement and may not authorize Consultant to perform Consulting Services. Pursuant to Zendesk Terms of Service agreed to by Customer (Subscription Terms), Customer is subscribing to the Service (as that term is defined in the Subscription Terms). Customer wishes to engage Consultant to receive the Consulting Services described herein, and Consultant agrees to provide the Consulting Services under this Agreement. In consideration of the foregoing, the Customer and the Consultant, intending to be legally bound, agree to the terms set forth below. 1. Scope. All services pursuant to this Agreement provided by Consultant to Customer will be outlined in one or more in one or more mutually agreed-upon and jointly executed SOW or service order form, each incorporated into this Agreement and describing in detail the scope, nature and other relevant characteristics of services to be delivered (collectively, Consulting Services, and the time at which the Parties execute an SOW pursuant to this Agreement, Effective Date). 2. Retention. Customer hereby retains Consultant to provide the Consulting Services described on one or more SOWs, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The terms and conditions of this Agreement will govern the provision of Consulting Services under any SOW (including any exhibits thereto) executed by the Parties. This Agreement and/or any SOW may only be amended by a subsequent Agreement and/or SOW mutually executed by the Parties (such subsequent document, Change Order). 3. Performance of Consulting Services. 3.1. Each SOW will include reasonable details, at a minimum, about the Consulting Services, Fees charged, and Personnel employed in performing the Consulting Services. Consultant and Customer agree to cooperate in good faith to achieve satisfactory completion of the Consulting Services in a timely and professional manner. 3.2. The Parties will each designate a representative to interface and facilitate the successful completion of the Consulting Services (Customers Representative and Consultants Representative, respectively). Any Subcontractor designated by Consultant to perform any portion of the Services will designate a representative to interface with Customer and Consultant on all matters relating to Subcontractors performance of Services (Subcontractors Representative). 3.3. Consultant will perform the Consulting Services, directly or through a Subcontractor of its choice. Customer agrees to provide, at no cost to Consultant, timely and adequate assistance and other resources reasonably requested by Consultant to enable the performance of the Consulting Services by Consultant (collectively, Assistance). Neither Consultant nor its Subcontractor will be liable for any deficiency in performance of Consulting Services to the extent resulting from Customers failure to provide Assistance as required hereunder. 3.4. In performing the Consulting Services, Consultant will provide such resources, and utilize such qualified employees and/or non-employee contractors of Consultant (Subcontractors and together with Consultants employees, Personnel) as it deems necessary to perform the Consulting Services or any portion thereof. Customer may object to Consultants election of Subcontractors by specifying its objection to Consultant, in which case the Parties will cooperate in good faith to appoint another Subcontractor to perform such Consulting Services. Consultant may replace Personnel in its normal course of business, provided that Consultant will be responsible for the performance of Consulting Services by all Personnel. 3.5. Consultant will control the method and manner of performing all work necessary for completion of Consulting Services, including but not limited to the supervision and control of any Personnel performing Consulting Services. Consultant will maintain such number of qualified Personnel and appropriate facilities and other resources sufficient to perform Consultants obligations under this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 3.6. No license to any Consultants, or any Subcontractors software or products (including, without limitation, the Service) is granted under this Agreement except as specifically provided pursuant to Section 10. 4. Fees; Payment Terms. 4.1. Customer will pay Consultant the fees to provide the Consulting Services as detailed or described in an SOW (the Fees). Fees will be payable upon receipt of an invoice, except for Fees that Customer disputes in good faith for reasons articulated in writing by Customer within thirty (30) days after receiving such invoice. 4.2. All Consulting Services will be provided on a time and materials or fixed-Fee basis, as indicated in each case in the applicable SOW. Each SOW providing for time and materials based Fees will contain detailed estimate of such time and materials necessary for performance of Consulting Services (T&M Estimate), and Consultant will make a commercially reasonable effort to provide such Consulting Services within such T&M Estimate, up to the number of hours agreed to by the Parties. Consultant will make a reasonable effort to notify Customer as soon as practicable if it appears that T&M Estimate may be exceeded. Upon receiving such amended T&M Estimate, Customer will assess, and accept or reject the amended T&M Estimate. Unless rejected within five (5) days of delivery, any amended T&M Estimate shall be deemed accepted by the Customer and Customer shall be liable for all Fees associated with Consulting Services delivered in reliance on such amended T&M Estimate. Any amended T&M Estimate which is or is deemed accepted by Customer shall be deemed a Change Order. 4.3. The performance of Consulting Services may be subject to a retainer to be paid in advance by Customer upon execution and delivery of the SOW. Such retainer will be applied against Fees which become payable by Customer pursuant to this Agreement. Consultant may refuse to perform Consulting Services unless and until such retainer is paid to Consultant. 4.4. In addition to any and all Fees, Customer will reimburse Consultant for the reasonable expenses for travel, lodging, communications, shipping charges and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Consultant in connection with providing the Consulting Services (Expenses,). Consultant will provide reasonable documentation for all Expenses as requested by Customer. 4.5. Any unpaid Fees or Expenses will become overdue 30 days after payment is required pursuant to this Agreement and be subject to a 1.5% late fee for each month of delayed payment (with each such 1.5% late fees attaching to such unpaid amounts at the first day of each 30 days time increments beginning on the first day that such amounts become overdue). Customer will be responsible for any and all taxes levied on transactions under this Agreement other than taxes on Consultants income. 5. Relationship of the Parties. Consultant is an independent contractor and will maintain complete control of and responsibility for its Personnel, methods and operations. Consultant at no time will hold itself out as an agent, subsidiary or affiliate of Customer for any purpose, including reporting to any government authority. This Agreement will not be construed so as to create a partnership, other joint venture or undertaking, or any agency relationship between the Parties, and neither Party shall become liable for any representation, act or omission of the other Party or have the authority to contractually bind the other Party. Any Fees, Expenses or other amounts paid by Customer to Consultant hereunder shall not be considered salary for pension or wage tax purposes and neither Consultant nor its Personnel will be entitled to any fringe benefits, including sick or vacation pay, or other supplemental benefits of Customer, Unless otherwise required by law, Customer shall not be responsible for deducting or withholding from Fees or Expenses paid under this Agreement any taxes, unemployment, social security or other such expense. 6. Term and Termination. 6.1. This Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will remain effective for as long as any SOW is in effect among the Parties, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Section 6. Any termination of this Agreement shall terminate any then-effective SOW. 6.2. This Agreement may be terminated by either party with or without cause upon no less than thirty (30) days advance written notice to the other Party. 6.3. Either Party may terminate this Agreement if the other Party materially breaches any obligation hereunder, provided the terminating Party has provided notice of such breach to the other Party and an opportunity to cure such breach during a period of not less than thirty (30) days following such notice. 6.4. Upon termination of this Agreement, Consultant will immediately cease performing any Consulting Services, and Customer will pay Consultant any Fees not yet paid for all Consulting Services provided pursuant to any SOW on or prior to such termination on a pro-rated basis (or on such other basis as the Parties will mutually agree) and reimburse Expenses incurred on or prior to termination not yet reimbursed. 6.5. Sections 4 through 16 of this Agreement will survive any termination of the Agreement to the extent necessary to implement their objectives. Termination of this Agreement will be without prejudice to other rights or remedies of any Party under this Agreement or applicable law, including, without limitation, any remedies for a breach of this Agreement prior to such termination. 7. Warranties, Limitation of Liability. 7.1. Consultant hereby represents and warrants that: (a) it has all authority, licenses, permits, and consents necessary to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement, and will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations in performing the Consulting Services; (b) the Consulting Services provided pursuant to this Agreement will be performed in a timely and professional manner by Consultant and its Personnel, consistent with generally-accepted industry standards; provided that Customers sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of this warranty will be, at Consultants option, re-performance of the Consulting Services or termination of the applicable SOW and return of the portion of the Fees paid to Consultant by Customer for the non-conforming portion of the Consulting Services; and (c) it is under no contractual or other restrictions or obligations which are inconsistent with the execution of this Agreement, or, to its best knowledge, which will interfere with its performance of the Consulting Services. 7.2. The Parties hereby agree that: (a) EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 7, CONSULTANT EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, NON-SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS AND TITLE, OR ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE, AND ALL SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW. (b) IF ONE OR MORE CUSTOM APPLICATIONS (“CUSTOM APPS) ARE INDENTIFIED AS BEING DELIVERED UNDER A SOW, SUCH CUSTOM APPS ARE PROVIDED TO CUSTOMER “AS IS” AND ZENDESK MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR ANY REPRESENTATIONS TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY REGARDING THE USABILITY, CONDITION, OPERATION OR FITNESS OF THE CUSTOM APP. ZENDESK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT YOUR OR ANY THIRD PARTY’S ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE CUSTOM APP SHALL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT IT WILL MEET ANY PARTICULAR CRITERIA OF PERFORMANCE OR QUALITY. ZENDESK EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES REGARDING CUSTOM APPS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, COMPATIBILITY, SECURITY OR ACCURACY. FURTHER, ZENDESK EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPPORT OR MAINTAIN CUSTOM APPS AND WILL NOT DO SO UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED BY THE PARTIES. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY AND LIABILITY IS EXPRESSLY MADE IN ADDITION TO ANY DISCLAIMERS MADE BY ZENDESK OR ITS AFFILIATES UNDER THE TERMS OF SERVICE WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES AS APPLICABLE TO YOUR AND ANY THIRD PARTY’S USE OF THE SERVICES. (c) THESE DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE EXPRESS WARRANTY AND LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH ABOVE FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. 7.3. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) WILL EITHER PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THEIR AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST SALES OR BUSINESS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER LOSS INCURRED BY THE OTHER PARTY OR SUCH THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE CONSULTING SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OR COULD HAVE FORESEEN SUCH DAMAGES. 7.4. EACH PARTYS AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CONSULTING SERVICES, SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY CUSTOMER PRIOR TO THE FIRST EVENT OR OCCURRENCE GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THIS SECTION 7.4 IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND LIMIT POTENTIAL LIABILITY GIVEN THE FEES, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IF CONSULTANT WERE TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER LIABILITY OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH HEREIN. CONSULTANT HAS RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER THE CONSULTING SERVICES PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT. 7.5. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. IN THESE JURISDICTIONS, EACH PARTYS LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 8. Indemnification. Consultant will indemnify and hold Customer harmless, from and against any claim against Customer alleging that any Work Made For Hire (as defined below) infringes or misappropriates a third partys valid patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret (an IP Claim). Consultant will, at its expense, defend such IP Claim and pay damages finally awarded against Customer in connection therewith, including the reasonable fees and expenses of the attorneys engaged by Consultant for such defense, provided that (a) Customer promptly notifies Consultant of the threat or notice of such IP Claim, (b) Consultant will have the sole and exclusive control and authority to select defense attorneys, defend and/or settle any such IP Claim, and (c) Customer fully cooperates with Consultant in connection therewith. Consultant will have no liability or obligation under this Section 8 with respect to any IP Claim if such claim is caused in whole or in part by (i) compliance with designs, data, instructions or specifications provided by Customer; (ii) modification of the Work Made For Hire by anyone other than Consultant; or (iii) the combination, operation or use of the Work Made For Hire with other hardware or software where the Work Made For Hire would not by itself be infringing. 9. Confidentiality. 9.1 For the purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means all information disclosed by Consultant to Customer or by Customer to Consultant which is in tangible form and labeled confidential (or with a similar legend) or which a reasonable person would understand to be confidential given the nature of the information and circumstances of disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include information that (a) was already known to the receiving party at the time of disclosure by the disclosing party; (b) was or is obtained by the receiving party by a third party not known by the receiving party to be under an obligation of confidentiality with respect to such information; (c) is or becomes generally available to the public other than by violation of these Terms; (d) was or is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the disclosing partys Confidential Information; (e) constitutes Subscriber Data (as that term is defined in the Subscription Terms), the use, protection and disclosure of which is governed exclusively by the Subscription Terms. 9.2 Subject to the express permissions of this Agreement, Consultant and Customer will protect each others Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access or disclosure in the same manner as each protects its own Confidential Information, but with no less than reasonable care. Except as otherwise expressly permitted pursuant to this Agreement, each Party may use the other Partys Confidential Information solely to exercise its respective rights and perform its respective obligations under this Agreement and shall disclose such Confidential Information solely to those of its Personnel who have a need to know such Confidential Information for such purposes and who are bound to maintain the confidentiality of, and not misuse, such Confidential Information. 9.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall not prevent the party receiving Confidential Information from disclosing such Confidential Information to the extent required by a judicial order or other legal obligation, provided that, in such event, the receiving party shall promptly notify the disclosing party of such requirement to allow intervention (and shall cooperate with the disclosing party at the disclosing partys expense) to contest or minimize the scope of the disclosure (including application for a protective order). 9.4 The Parties acknowledge that any unpermitted disclosure of a partys Confidential Information is likely to cause the disclosing party irreparable harm for which its remedies at law would be inadequate. Accordingly, each Party (as the receiving party) acknowledges and agrees that the Party disclosing Confidential Information will be entitled, in addition to any other remedies available to it at law or in equity, to the issuance of injunctive relief, without bond, enjoining any breach or threatened breach of the receiving partys obligations hereunder with respect to the Confidential Information of the disclosing party, and such further relief as any court of competent jurisdiction may deem just and proper. 9.5 Upon termination of this Agreement or a request by a disclosing party, each party, as a receiving party of Confidential Information, will return to the disclosing party any and all copies of the material containing the other partys Confidential Information, or any portion thereof, in the possession of the receiving party, except for information necessary to implement the objectives of this Agreement after its termination. 10 Rights to Deliverables; Ownership. 10.1 The Parties hereby agree that the specified Consulting Services to be completed pursuant to any SOW primarily involve the configuration of Subscribers subscription to the Service and integration of Subscriber Data with and into the Service involving Preexisting Technology or meant to constitute Developed Technology or Generic Components (each as defined below). Unless otherwise expressly specified in a SOW, no deliverable provided in connection with the Consulting Services provided pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute a “Work Made For Hire” under this Agreement. In the event that any such deliverable is held to be a Work Made For Hire, Customer hereby assigns to Consultant all right title and interest therein or to the extent such assignment is not permitted or effective, hereby grants to Consultant a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully-paid, sublicenceable (through multiple layers), assignable license to any such deliverable. Subject to Section 10.2, Customer and Consultant agree that Customer shall retain all right, title and interest in any deliverable expressly stated in an SOW to be a Work Made for Hire. 10.2 Without limiting the foregoing, Consultant and its licensors reserve and retain ownership to all Preexisting Technology, Developed Technology and Generic Components (each as defined below), and Consultant hereby grants to Customer a non-exclusive, fully paid, limited license to use Preexisting Technology, Developed Technology and Generic Components solely in connection with Customers use of the Service. Preexisting Technology means all of Consultants inventions (whether or not patentable), works of authorship, designs, know-how, ideas, concepts, information and tools in existence prior to the commencement of the Consulting Services. Developed Technology means ideas (whether or not patentable) know-how, technical data, techniques, concepts, information or tools, and all associated intellectual property rights thereto developed by Consultant or its Personnel in connection with providing Consulting Services pursuant to this Agreement that derive from, improve, enhance or modify Consultants Preexisting Technology. Generic Components means all inventions (whether or not patentable), works of authorship, designs, know-how, ideas, information and tools, including without limitation software and programming tools developed by Consultant or its Personnel in connection with providing Consulting Services generally to support Consultants product and/or service offerings (including, without limitation the Service) and which can be so used without use of Customers Confidential Information. 11 Entire Agreement. This Agreement thereto constitutes the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement among the Parties with respect to the Consulting Services to be provided pursuant to this Agreement, and supersedes all prior negotiations, understandings or agreements (oral or written), between the Parties concerning its subject matter. Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties agree and acknowledge that this Agreement shall have no effect on the rights and obligations of the Parties pursuant to the Subscription Terms (or the Agreement as defined therein). 12 Waiver. The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period will not be construed as a waiver of such rights. No change, modification or waiver to this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by both Parties. 13 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement will, for any reason, be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will be interpreted as closely as possible so as not affect any other provision of this Agreement, and such provision will further be modified by said court to permit its enforcement to the maximum extent permitted by law. 14 Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflicts of law provisions thereof.

To review our updated policy, click here. At Zendesk, We respect and protect the privacy of visitors to our website, (the “Site”), and our customers who use our on-demand support platform, tools and services offered on the Site (the “Service”). This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how We collect and use visitors’ and customers’ information as part of our Site and our Service. To mark its commitment to privacy, Zendesk has entered into a number of voluntary data privacy programs, including the TRUSTe® Privacy Certification Programs, and the United States  European Union and the US-Swiss Safe Harbor programs. We have been awarded TRUSTe’s Privacy Seal signifying that this Policy and our privacy practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe’s Program Requirements and Cloud Privacy Requirements, including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. TRUSTe’s mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy programs. Zendesk also complies with the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from EU member countries and Switzerland. We have certified our adherence to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement. Our compliance has been recognized by TRUSTe, which has awarded Zendesk the TRUSTe’s EU Safe Harbor Seal. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Zendesk’s certification, please visit If You have questions or complaints regarding our Policy or practices, please contact us at privacy@zendesk. If You are not satisfied with our response or We do not respond to your query within 30 days, You can contact TRUSTe here. We self-certify compliance with: INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE In this Policy, “personal information” means information or an information set that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of Zendesk to identify an individual, but not including encoded, anonymized, or publically-available data that has not been combined with non-public personal information. The information Zendesk collects and uses is limited to the purpose for which customers engage Zendesk. When You register for the Service, We ask for information such as your name, company name and address, site name, phone number, e-mail address and credit card information. If You sign-up for the 30-day free trial account, You are not required to enter your credit card information until You decide to continue with a paid plan. Zendesk uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on Zendesk’s behalf. Zendesk may use the personal information and other information We collect about your use of the Service to operate the Service and tailor it to your needs, for billing, identification and authentication, to contact You about your use of the Service, send you marketing materials (subject to your opt-out option), for research purposes, and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Service and the Site. Zendesk may also share your personal information with its third-party vendors (such as its credit card processor) and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other services We use to operate the Service and maintain quality user experience. Although Zendesk owns all rights to the software, code, databases, and other Service applications, You retain all rights to your data. Our service providers may not use your personal information for marketing purposes. COOKIES AND CLEAR GIFS (A.K.A. WEB BEACONS) A “cookie” is a small software file stored temporarily (session cookie) or placed on your computer’s hard drive (persistent cookie). The main purpose of a cookie is to allow a web server to identify a user’s computer and web browser, and tailor web pages and/or login information to the user’s preferences. Cookies help us promptly display the information You need and other information which We consider to be of interest to You. By gathering and remembering information about your website preferences through cookies We can provide a better web and marketing experience. Cookies don’t give us access to users’ computers, and the information we collect through cookies doesn’t include personal information. When You visit the Site or use the Service We use “session cookies” to allow us to uniquely identify your browser while You are logged in, and to process your online transactions. We also use “persistent cookies” that only We can read and use, to identify You as a Zendesk customer and make it easier for You to log into the Service. Essential cookies: Some of the cookies We use are critical to the functionality of our Site. They are used to keep a user logged into the Site and remember relevant information when the user returns to the Site and uses the Service. Functional cookies: We also use certain cookies to track users’ activities on the Site, understand their preferences within the Site and improve their user experience. Marketing cookies: A third set of cookies is provided by third parties and allows us to deliver customized marketing information to our customers based on their Site usage profile and avoid delivering irrelevant marketing to customers. Clear gifs: Our third-party tracking utility company employs a software technology called clear gifs that helps us better manage content on our Site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information, and use them in our HTML-based emails to learn which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and our marketing campaigns. Customers can opt-out of these emails by following the unsubscribe instructions within such marketing emails. Below We list the main cookies We use and explain what each cookie does: Session cookies: our main application uses session cookies to serve users using the Service: (i) _zendesk_session: used to track users and session state on our primary application. (ii) zendesk_shared_session: uses to seamlessly integrate the user session with other Service components. (iii) zd_auth_token: retains session if customer clicks on “remember me.” Preferences cookies: we also use a cookie called oid_user when a user prefers to login via OpenID. Marketing cookies: we also serve cookies via our third party providers to users who visit our Site: (i) Marketo: allows us to offer the Service to active and repeating Site visitors. (ii) Google Analytics: allows us to understand how people interact with the Site, and help us to optimize Site performance, usability and users’ experience. (iii) Google Adwords: allow us to deliver targeted information to users who look for our Service. (iv) Retargeter: used to deliver relevant and targeted ads to visitors of our Site, to help in enhancing their Site experience. (v) Quantcast: used to deliver relevant and targeted ads to visitors of similar services. Controlling cookies: you can accept or decline the use of cookies through a functionality built into your web browser. To learn more how to control cookie settings through your browser: Click here to learn more about the “Private Browsing” setting and cookie setting in FireFox; Click here to learn more about “Incognito” and cookie setting in Chrome; Click here to learn more about “InPrivate” and cookie setting in Internet Explorer; or Click here to learn more about “Private Browsing” and cookie setting in Safari. If You want to learn more about cookies, or how to control or delete them, please visit for detailed guidance. If You disable Your web browser’s ability to accept cookies You still will be able to browse our Site, but might not be able to access or take advantage of the many Service features. Log Files As is true with most web sites, Zendesk gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes internet protocol addresses as well as browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. Occasionally We may connect personal information to data gathered in our log files, as necessary to improve the Service to individual customers. Otherwise We mostly use this information with no connection to individual users, to analyze trends, administer the Site, or track usage of various features within the Site. LINKS TO OTHER SITES Our Site contains links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by Zendesk. Please be aware that We do not determine and We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other sites. We encourage You to be aware when you leave our Site, and read the privacy statements of other websites linked to our Site. This Policy applies only to information collected by this Site. PUBLIC FORUMS Our Site offers publicly-accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information You provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at privacy@zendesk. In some cases, We may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case We will let You know if We are unable to do so and why. CUSTOMER TESTIMONIALS/COMMENTS/REVIEWS From time to time, We post customer testimonials on the Site which may contain personal information. We do obtain the customers’ consent to post their names along with their testimonials. INFORMATION SHARING Except as described in this Policy, Zendesk will not give, sell, rent or loan any personal information to any third party. We may disclose such information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. Zendesk may also provide non-personal, summary or group statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personal information. PROTECTION OF INFORMATION Zendesk is committed to ensuring the security of your personal information. We take every precaution to protect the confidentiality and security of the personal information placed on the Site or used within the Service, by employing technological, physical and administrative security safeguards, such as firewalls and carefully-developed security procedures. For example, when You enter sensitive information (such as login credentials and all your activity on our Service platform) We encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). These technologies, procedures and other measures help ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to You and to those You authorized access. SAFE HARBOR DATA PRIVACY NOTICE FOR EUROPEAN UNION WEB SITE VISITORS AND CLIENTS Zendesk complies with the US  EU and US  Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks for protecting the privacy of data flowing from the EU and Switzerland to the US, as set forth by the US Department of Commerce. Below We outline our practices for implementing the Safe Harbor Principles, including the type of information to which this notice applies, how We collect, use and retain personal information from EU member countries and Switzerland, and the choices individuals have regarding our use of, and their ability to correct, their personal information. GENERALLY We frequently enter agreements with our EU customers to provide them our Service, which includes the processing of information relating to our customers’ customers. In providing our Service We do not own, control or direct the use of the information stored or processed on our platform at the direction of our customers, and in fact We are largely unaware of what information is actually being stored on our platform and only access such information as authorized by our customers or as required by law. Only You or your customers are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such information. As such, We are only the “data processors” and not the “data controllers” of the information on our platform for purposes of the EU Directive on Data Protection (Directive 95/46/EC) and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection. Our EU or Swiss customers, who control their customer data and send it to Zendesk for processing, are the “controllers” of that data and are responsible for compliance with the Directive. As the processors of personal information on behalf of our European customers, we follow their instructions with respect to the information they control. In doing so We implement appropriate technical, physical and administrative measures against unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of, or damage to, personal information. NOTICE Where Zendesk collects personal information directly from its EU customers, it informs them about the purpose for which it collects and uses their personal information, the choices they have to limit the use of personal information about them, and how to contact Zendesk. Beyond that, We have no direct relationship with our customers’ customers whose personal data We processes. Zendesk’s customers are responsible for complying with the Directive and relevant data protection legislation in the relevant EU member state before sending personal data to Zendesk for processing. We work with our customers to help them provide notice to their customers concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected. CHOICE We process and store information on behalf of our customers. If You are a customer of one of our customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers that uses our Service, please contact that customer directly. If You are our customer and would like to opt-out of getting communications from Zendesk please contact us at privacy@zendesk or follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each marketing email. Requests to opt-out of transfers to our third-party vendors will also be considered, but limitations on data sharing may make it difficult or impossible to provide the Service. ONWARDS TRANSFER We may transfer personal information to our third-party vendors that help us provide the Service, subject to appropriate confidentiality restrictions. Such transfers are limited to the purposes for which personal data has been transferred to us from our customers. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this Policy regarding notice and choice, and the service agreements with our customers. Otherwise We may also share personal information as is required or permitted by law. ACCESS AND REVIEW OF MY DATA Residents of the EU and Switzerland whose personal information Zendesk controls may request access and the opportunity to correct, amend, or delete that information. If You are our customer and would like to gain access to, or request deletion of information We have collected as “data controllers,” please contact us at privacy@zendesk. We will respond to such queries within 30 business days. Zendesk has no direct relationship with its customers’ customers whose personal data it processes. An individual seeking access, or who would like to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the Zendesk customer with whom such individual interacts (the data controller). At the request of our customers We remove data within 30 business days. DATA RETENTION Zendesk will retain personal information We process on behalf of our customers for as long as needed to provide Service to our customers, subject to our compliance with this Policy. We retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. ENFORCEMENT Zendesk will continuously monitor its privacy practices and continued compliance with the Directive and this Policy. CHILDREN’S PERSONAL INFORMATION Zendesk does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY If We make any material changes to this Policy We will notify You by email or by posting a prominent notice on the Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage You to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your continued use of the Site or Service constitutes your agreement to be bound by such changes to this Policy. Your only remedy, if You do not accept the terms of this Policy, is to discontinue use of the Site and Service. BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS Zendesk may assign or transfer this Policy, and your user account and related information and data, to any person or entity that acquires or is merged with Zendesk. TERMS OF SERVICE When You access and use the Service, You are subject to the Zendesk Terms of Service.

These safeguards include encryption of Your Data in transmission (using SSL or similar technologies), except for certain Other Services that do not support encryption, which You may link to through Service at Your election.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ZENDESK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR-FREE OR FREE FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS SOFTWARE, AND NO INFORMATION OR ADVICE OBTAINED BY YOU FROM ZENDESK OR THROUGH THE SERVICE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 9.1 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) WILL ZENDESK, OR ZENDESKS AFFILIATES OR ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST SALES OR BUSINESS, LOST DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER LOSS INCURRED BY YOU OR SUCH THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ZENDESK HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OR COULD HAVE FORESEEN SUCH DAMAGES. 9.2 NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THESE TERMS, ZENDESKS AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUBSCRIPTION TO, OR USE OR EMPLOYMENT OF THE SERVICE, SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE PAYMENTS MADE BY RESELLER TO ZENDESK WITH RESPECT TO YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO THE SERVICE DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE FIRST EVENT OR OCCURRENCE GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY.

IN THESE JURISDICTIONS, ZENDESKS LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 10.

SEVERABILITY If any provision in these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as to best accomplish the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in effect. 13.

Zendesk is a recognized Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) Data Intermediary as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Service Provider (IDA Cloud Booklet 2015). As a Data Intermediary Zendesk complies with the Protection and Retention Limitation Obligations of the Act. Details are set out below. BACKGROUND OF THE PDPA AND HOW IT APPLIES TO US The following is a brief summary of how we comply with and/or relate to the specific laws and privacy protection principles established by the government of Singapore. The PDPA establishes data protection laws which govern the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Data (the “Data Protection Provisions”). Defined terms not defined herein shall have the meaning set for in our Privacy Policy. Whether and to what extent the obligations imposed by the Data Protection Provisions apply depends on (i) whether we are operating in the capacity of a data principal or a data intermediary when Processing Personal Data in the provision of the Zendesk Service and/or Zopim Service (as applicable). “Processing” in relation to Personal Data under the PDPA means the carrying out of any operation or set of operations in relation to Personal Data, and includes recording, holding, organisation, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, combination, transmission, erasure or destruction. ActivityApplicability of Data Protection ProvisionsProcesses Personal Data when a Subscriber registers for an account for the Service or registers Agents to use the Service are a data principal Processing Personal Data for these purposes. As the information collected constitutes “business contact information,” the obligations of the PDPA do not apply. Processes Personal Data through Subscriber’s use of the Service. We are a data intermediary for these purposes; and, we are only subject to the two obligations imposed by the Data Protection Provisions relating to the protection and retention of Personal Data. OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY THE DATA PROTECTION PROVISIONS The Data Protection Provisions generally require an organization (which term includes any individual, company, association or body of persons, corporate or unincorporated) to be responsible for Personal Data of individuals in its possession or under its control, and to develop and implement policies that are necessary to meet the following obligations: The obligation to obtain, on or before the collection, the individual’s consent to the collection, use and disclosure of the individual’s Personal Data (the “Consent Obligation”). The obligation to ensure that Personal Data is collected, used and disclosed only for purposes which consent was given or which a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances (the “Purpose Limitation Obligation”). The obligation to notify the individual, on or before collection, use or disclosure, the purposes for which it is collecting, using and/or disclosing the individual’s Personal Data (the “Notification Obligation”). The obligation to provide, upon the request of the individual, information about the ways in which the individual’s Personal Data has been or may have been used or disclosed in the year before the request, and allow the individual to correct his/her Personal Data (the “Access and Correction Obligation”). The obligation to use reasonable effort to ensure that the Personal Data collected by or on its behalf is accurate and complete (the “Accuracy Obligation”). The obligation to make reasonable security arrangements to protect the Personal Data and prevent unauthorised access, collection, use disclosure or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”). The obligation to cease retaining Personal Data or remove the means by which the Personal Data can be associated with an individual when the personal data is no longer necessary for business or legal purpose (“Retention Limitation Obligation”). The obligation not to transfer Personal Data to a country or territory outside of Singapore except in accordance with the requirements under PDPA (“Transfer Limitation Obligation”). The obligation to make information about its data protection policies, practices and complaints process available on request, and designating one or more individuals as its data protection officer to ensure that the organisation complies with the PDPA (“Openness Obligation”). The PDPA applies only to Personal Data of individuals given in a personal capacity, for personal purposes and does not apply to “business contact information” which is defined in the PDPA as “an individual’s name, position name or title, business telephone number, business address, business electronic mail address or business fax number and any other similar information about the individual, not provided by the individual solely for his personal purposes”. An organization is not required to obtain consent or otherwise comply with the PDPA in collecting, using or disclosing any business contact information disclosed in the course of a commercial transaction. PERSONAL DATA PROVIDED BY SUBSCRIBERS TO US Personal Data is collected when an Account is created by a Subscriber or when Agents are registered to use the Service. This information consitutes business contact information for purposes of the PDPA. In this regard, we are not required to obtain consent or comply with the Data Protection Provisions in relation to such Personal Data. We do, however as a matter of good business practices describe how we collect, use, disclose and Process this Personal Data in our Privacy Policy. HOW WE COMPLY WITH THE PDPA AS A DATA INTERMEDIARY WITH REGARD TO PERSONAL DATA IN THE SERVICE We act as a data intermediary in connection with the use of the Service by our Subscribers and their Agents. Data intermediaries who process Personal Data on behalf of other organisations are only required to comply with two obligations under the PDPA when Processing this Personal Data: the Protection Obligation; andthe Retention Limitation Obligation The Protection Obligation requires us to put in place appropriate administrative, physical and technical measures to prevent unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks to the Personal Data in our possession or under our control, regardless whether the Personal Data is stored in a central server, or on local storage media, or at facilities operated by a third party vendor. We utilize robust precautions to protect the confidentiality and security of the Personal Data within the Service, by employing technological, physical and administrative security safeguards, such as firewalls and carefully developed security procedures. These technologies, procedures and other measures are used in an effort to ensure that Personal Data is safe, secure, and only available to Subscribers and to those authorized to access such Personal Data. However, no internet, e-mail or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so Subscribers should take care in deciding what information is transmitted, stored or hosted through the Service. The Retention Limitation Obligation requires us to cease to retain Personal Data which is Processed or remove the means by which the Personal Data can be associated with particular individuals, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that the purpose for which the Personal Data was collected is no longer being served by retention of the Personal Data; and, the retention of the Personal Data is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes. If you wish to make a complaint about the way we have handled your Personal Data (including if you think we have breached any applicable privacy laws), you may do so to our Privacy Officer in writing, by mail or email to the address or email address set out in the ‘Contact Us’ section of our Privacy Policy. Please include your full name, contact details and a detailed description of your complaint.

For avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not, in any event, be deemed to limit any other manner of Processing of such Personal Data within the Zendesk Group or to authorized service providers whether in the European Economic Area, the United States or elsewhere. 4.

Zendesk®, and Zendesks other product and service names, and logos used or displayed on the Service are registered or unregistered trademarks of Zendesk (collectively, Marks), and You may only use such Marks to identify You as a Subscriber; provided You do not attempt, now or in the future, to claim any rights in the Marks, degrade the distinctiveness of the Marks, or use the Marks to disparage or misrepresent Zendesk, its services or products. 5.

Zendesk may disable the phone numbers provided to You if unused or substantially underused for 60 days, or if Your subscription to the Service, Account or rights to access and/or use the Service is otherwise suspended, terminates or cancelled. Use of Zendesk Voice is subject to the payment of additional fees and charges, including, without limitation, the phone call rates as detailed on the Site. When enabling Zendesk Voice, You are consenting, on behalf of You and Your Agents and End-Users to the Processing of Your Data (as generated by or necessary for the provision or operation of Zendesk Voice) by the third party service provider we utilize to provide Zendesk Voice. 7. BILLING, PLAN MODIFICATIONS AND PAYMENTS 7.1 Unless otherwise indicated on a Form referencing these Terms and subject to Section 7.2, all charges associated with Your access to and use of the Service (Subscription Charges) are due in full upon commencement of Your Subscription Term. Subscription Charges for Zendesk Voice may be charged in arrears or, at Our election, by requiring You to prepay for expected usage. If You fail to pay Your Subscription Charges or charges for other services indicated on any Form referencing these Terms within five (5) business days of Our notice to You that payment is due or delinquent, or if You do not update payment information upon Our request, in addition to Our other remedies, We may suspend or terminate access to and use of the Service by You, Agents and End Users. 7.2 If You choose to upgrade Your Service Plan or increase the number of authorized Agents during Your Subscription Term (a Subscription Upgrade), any incremental Subscription Charges associated with such Subscription Upgrade will be prorated over the remaining period of Your then current Subscription Term, charged to Your Account and due and payable upon implementation of such Subscription Upgrade. In any future Subscription Term, Your Subscription Charges will reflect any such Subscription Upgrades. 7.3 No refunds or credits for Subscription Charges or other fees or payments will be provided to You if You elect to downgrade Your Service Plan. Downgrading Your Service Plan may cause loss of content, features, or capacity of the Service as available to You under Your Account, and Zendesk does not accept any liability for such loss. Zendesk reserves the right to contact You about special pricing if You maintain an exceptionally high number of End Users, an unusually high monthly ticket ratio per Agent, an unusually high level of open tickets or other excessive stress on the Service. 7.4 Unless otherwise stated, Our charges do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes assessable by any local, state, provincial or foreign jurisdiction (collectively Taxes). You are responsible for paying Taxes except those assessable against Zendesk based on its income. We will invoice You for such Taxes if We believe We have a legal obligation to do so and You agree to pay such Taxes if so invoiced. 7.5 If You pay by credit card, the Service provides an interface for the account owner to change credit card information (e.g. upon card renewal). The Account owner will receive a receipt upon each receipt of payment by Zendesk, or they may obtain a receipt from within the Service to track subscription status. You hereby authorize Zendesk to bill Your credit card or other payment instrument in advance on a periodic basis in accordance with the terms of the Service Plan until you terminate your Subscription, and you further agree to pay any Subscription Charges so incurred. Zendesk uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain or use Your billing information except to process Your credit card information for Zendesk. 8.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ZENDESK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR-FREE OR FREE FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS SOFTWARE, AND NO INFORMATION OR ADVICE OBTAINED BY YOU FROM ZENDESK OR THROUGH THE SERVICE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. 10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 10.1 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) WILL EITHER PARTY TO THESE TERMS, OR THEIR AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST SALES OR BUSINESS, LOST DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER LOSS INCURRED BY SUCH PARTY OR THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OR COULD HAVE FORESEEN SUCH DAMAGES. 10.2 NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THESE TERMS, ZENDESKS AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUBSCRIPTION TO, OR USE OR EMPLOYMENT OF THE SERVICE, SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE SUBSCRIPTION CHARGES PAID BY YOU DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE FIRST EVENT OR OCCURRENCE GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THIS SECTION 10.2 IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND LIMIT POTENTIAL LIABILITY GIVEN THE SUBSCRIPTION CHARGES, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IF ZENDESK WERE TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER LIABILITY OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH HEREIN. ZENDESK HAS RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO PROVIDE YOU THE RIGHTS TO ACCESS AND USE THE SERVICE PROVIDED FOR IN THESE TERMS. 10.3 Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply to You. IN THESE JURISDICTIONS, ZENDESKS LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 11. INDEMNIFICATION 11.1 Zendesk will indemnify and hold You harmless, from and against any claim against You by reason of Your use of the Service as permitted hereunder, brought by a third party alleging that the Service infringes or misappropriates a third partys valid patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret (an IP Claim). Zendesk shall, at its expense, defend such IP Claim and pay damages finally awarded against You in connection therewith, including the reasonable fees and expenses of the attorneys engaged by Zendesk for such defense, provided that (a) You promptly notify Zendesk of the threat or notice of such IP Claim, (b) Zendesk will have the sole and exclusive control and authority to select defense attorneys, defend and/or settle any such IP Claim, and (c) You fully cooperate with Zendesk in connection therewith. If use of the Service by You, Agents or End Users has become, or in Zendesks opinion is likely to become, the subject of any such IP Claim, Zendesk may at its option and expense (a) procure for You the right to continue using the Service as set forth hereunder; (b) replace or modify the Service to make it non-infringing; or (c) if options (a) or (b) are not commercially and reasonably practicable as determined by Zendesk, terminate Your subscription to the Service and repay You, on a pro-rated basis, any Subscription Charges previously paid to Zendesk for the corresponding unused portion of Your Subscription Term. Zendesk will have no liability or obligation under this Section 11.1 with respect to any IP Claim if such claim is caused in whole or in part by (i) compliance with designs, data, instructions or specifications provided by You; (ii) modification of the Service by anyone other than Zendesk; or (iii) the combination, operation or use of the Service with other hardware or software where the Service would not by itself be infringing. The provisions of this Section 11.1 state the sole, exclusive and entire liability of Zendesk to You and constitute Your sole remedy with respect to an IP Claim brought by reason of access to or use of the Service by You, Agents or End Users. 11.2 You will indemnify and hold Zendesk harmless against any claim brought by a third party against Zendesk arising from or related to use of the Service by You, Agents or End Users in breach of these Terms or matters which You have expressly agreed to be responsible pursuant to these Terms; provided that Zendesk promptly notifies You of the threat or notice of such a claim. 12. ASSIGNMENT; ENTIRE AGREEMENT; REVISIONS 12.1 You may not, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, assign all or any part of these Terms or Your rights under these Terms or delegate performance of Your duties under these Terms without Zendesks prior consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. We may, without Your consent, assign Our agreement with You to any member of the Zendesk Group or in connection with any merger or change of control of Zendesk or the sale of all or substantially all of Our assets provided that any such successor agrees to fulfill its obligations pursuant to these Terms. Subject to the foregoing restrictions, these Terms will be fully binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 12.2 These Terms, together with any Form(s), constitute the entire agreement, and supersede any and all prior agreements between You and Zendesk with regard to the subject matter hereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, additional terms may apply to certain features or functionality Zendesk offers through the Service (the “Additional Terms”). In those instances, We will notify You of such Additional Terms prior to the activation of these features or functionality and the activation of these features or functionality in Your Account will be considered acceptance of the Additional Terms. All such Additional Terms will be considered incorporated into these Terms when You or any Agent designated as an administrator on your Account activates the feature or functionality. Where theres a conflict between these Terms and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control. 12.3 We may amend these Terms from time to time, in which case the new Terms will supersede prior versions. We will notify You not less than ten (10) days prior to the effective date of any such amendment and Your continued use of the Service following the effective date of any such amendment may be relied upon by Zendesk as Your consent to any such amendment. Zendesks failure to enforce at any time any provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision or of any other provision of the Terms. 13. SEVERABILITY If any provision in these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as to best accomplish the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in effect. 14.

You shall not access or use the Service if You are located in any jurisdiction in which the provision of the Service, Software or other components is prohibited under U.S. or other applicable laws or regulations (a Prohibited Jurisdiction) and You shall not provide access to the Service to any government, entity or individual located in any Prohibited Jurisdiction.

RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES The parties are independent contractors. These Terms do not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship among the parties. 16. SURVIVAL Sections 1, 3, 4 and 9-19 shall survive any termination of our agreement with respect to use of the Service by You, Agents or End Users. Termination of such agreement shall not limit Your or Zendesks liability for obligations accrued as of or prior to such termination or for any breach of these Terms. 17.

You are responsible for procuring and maintaining the network connections that connect Your network to the Service, including, but not limited to, “browser” software that supports protocols used by Zendesk, including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol or other protocols accepted by Zendesk, and to follow procedures for accessing services that support such protocols.

Subject to any limitation on the number of individual Agents available under the Service Plan for which You subscribed, access to and use of the Service is restricted to the specified number of individual Agents permitted under Your subscription to the Service. You agree and acknowledge that each Agent will be identified by a unique username and password (Login) and that an Agent Login may only be used by one (1) individual. You will not share an Agent Login among multiple individuals.

You and Your Agents are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of all Login information for Your Account. 2.5 In addition to Our rights as set forth in Section 8.4, Zendesk reserves the right, in Zendesks reasonable discretion, to temporarily suspend Your access to and use of the Service: (a) during planned downtime for upgrades and maintenance to the Service (of which Zendesk will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify You in advance both through Our forum page and a notice to Your Account owner and Agents) (Planned Downtime); (b) during any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond Our reasonable control, such as, but not limited to, acts of God, acts of government, acts of terror or civil unrest, technical failures beyond Our reasonable control (including, without limitation, inability to access the Internet), or acts undertaken by third parties, including without limitation, distributed denial of service attacks; or (c) if We suspect or detect any Malicious Software connected to Your Account or use of the Service by You, Agents or End Users. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to schedule Planned Downtime for weekends (Pacific time zone) and other off-peak hours. 3. DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY; CONFIDENTIALITY 3.1 Subject to the express permissions of these Terms, You and Zendesk will protect each others Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access or disclosure in the same manner as each protects its own Confidential Information, but with no less than reasonable care. Except as otherwise expressly permitted pursuant to these Terms, each of us may use each others Confidential Information solely to exercise our respective rights and perform our respective obligations under these Terms and shall disclose such Confidential Information solely to those of our respective employees, representatives and agents who have a need to know such Confidential Information for such purposes and who are bound to maintain the confidentiality of, and not misuse, such Confidential Information. 3.2 Zendesk will maintain commercially reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of Your Data. These safeguards include encryption of Your Data in transmission (using SSL or similar technologies), except for certain Other Services that do not support encryption, which You may link to through Service at Your election. Our compliance with the provisions of this Section 3.2 shall be deemed compliance with Our obligations to protect Your Data as set forth in Section 3.1. 3.3 You agree that Zendesk and the service providers We use to assist in providing the Service to You shall have the right to access Your Account and to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, display and disclose Your Data solely to the extent necessary to provide the Service, including, without limitation, in response to Your support requests. Any third party service providers We utilize will only be given access to Your Account and Your Data as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service and will be subject to confidentiality obligations. Zendesk may also access or disclose information about You, Your Account, Agents or End Users, including Your Data, in order to (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect Zendesks or its customers or partners rights or property, including enforcement of these Terms or other policies associated with the Service; (c) act on a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to protect personal safety or avoid violation of applicable law or regulation. 3.4 We collect certain information about You, Agents and End Users as well as Your and their respective devices, computers and use of the Service. We use, disclose, and protect this information as described in Our Privacy Policy, the then-current version of which is available at and is incorporated into the Terms. 4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS Each of us shall maintain all rights, title and interest in and to all our respective patents, inventions, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, know-how and any other intellectual property and/or proprietary rights (collectively, Intellectual Property Rights). The rights granted to You, Agents and End Users to use the Service under these Terms do not convey any additional rights in the Service, or in any Intellectual Property Rights associated therewith. Subject only to limited rights to access and use the Service as expressly herein, all rights, title and interest in and to the Service and all hardware, software and other components of or used to provide the Service, including all related intellectual property rights, will remain with and belong exclusively to Zendesk. Zendesk shall have a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to incorporate into the Service or otherwise use any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or other feedback We receive from You, Agents or End Users. Zendesk®, and Zendesks other product and service names, and logos used or displayed on the Service are registered or unregistered trademarks of Zendesk (collectively, Marks), and You may only use such Marks to identify You as a Subscriber; provided You do not attempt, now or in the future, to claim any rights in the Marks, degrade the distinctiveness of the Marks, or use the Marks to disparage or misrepresent Zendesk, its services or products. 5. THIRD PARTY SERVICES If You decide to enable, access or use Other Services, be advised that Your access and use of such Other Services is governed solely by the terms and conditions of such Other Services, and We do not endorse, are not responsible or liable for, and make no representations as to any aspect of such Other Services, including, without limitation, their content or the manner in which they handle data (including Your Data) or any interaction between You and the provider of such Other Services. You irrevocably waive any claim against Zendesk with respect to such Other Services. Zendesk is not liable for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with Your enablement, access or use of any such Other Services, or Your reliance on the privacy practices, data security processes or other policies of such Other Services. You may be required to register for or log into such Other Services on their respective websites. By enabling any Other Services, You are expressly permitting Zendesk to disclose Your Login as well as Your Data as necessary to facilitate the use or enablement of such Other Service. 6. VOICE FUNCTIONALITY If Your Service Plan and subscription to the Service allows You to use the Zendesk Voice service, You understand and agree that (a) the Service is not intended to support or carry emergency calls to any emergency services such as public safety answering points, (b) Zendesk will not be held liable for any claim, damages or loss (and You hereby waive any and all such claims or causes of action), arising from or relating to Your (or Agents or End Users) inability to use the Service to make such emergency calls, (c) You are solely responsible for Your operation of Zendesk Voice in compliance with all applicable laws in all jurisdictions governing use of the Service by You, Agents and End Users, including but not limited to telephone recording and wiretapping laws, and (d) You will defend, hold harmless and indemnify Zendesk from and against any third party claim arising from any of the foregoing. Zendesk may disable the phone numbers provided to You if unused or substantially underused for 60 days, or if Your subscription to the Service, Account or rights to access and/or use the Service is otherwise suspended, terminates or cancelled. Use of Zendesk Voice is subject to the payment of additional fees and charges, including, without limitation, the phone call rates as detailed on the Site. 7. BILLING, PLAN MODIFICATIONS AND PAYMENTS 7.1 Unless otherwise indicated on a Form referencing these Terms and subject to Section 7.2, all charges associated with Your access to and use of the Service (Subscription Charges) are due in full upon commencement of Your Subscription Term. If You fail to pay Your Subscription Charges or charges for other services indicated on any Form referencing these Terms within five (5) business days of Our notice to You that payment is due or delinquent, or if You do not update payment information upon Our request, in addition to Our other remedies, We may suspend or terminate access to and use of the Service by You, Agents and End Users. 7.2 If You choose to upgrade Your Service Plan or increase the number of authorized Agents during Your Subscription Term (a Subscription Upgrade), any incremental Subscription Charges associated with such Subscription Upgrade will be prorated over the remaining period of Your then current Subscription Term, charged to Your Account and due and payable upon implementation of such Subscription Upgrade. In any future Subscription Term, Your Subscription Charges will reflect any such Subscription Upgrades. 7.3 No refunds or credits for Subscription Charges or other fees or payments will be provided to You if You elect to downgrade Your Service Plan. Downgrading Your Service Plan may cause loss of content, features, or capacity of the Service as available to You under Your Account, and Zendesk does not accept any liability for such loss. Zendesk reserves the right to contact You about special pricing if You maintain an exceptionally high number of End Users, an unusually high monthly ticket ratio per Agent, an unusually high level of open tickets or other excessive stress on the Service. 7.4 Unless otherwise stated, Our charges do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes assessable by any local, state, provincial or foreign jurisdiction (collectively Taxes). You are responsible for paying Taxes except those assessable against Zendesk based on its income. We will invoice You for such Taxes if We believe We have a legal obligation to do so and You agree to pay such Taxes if so invoiced. 7.5 If You pay by credit card, the Service provides an interface for the account owner to change credit card information (e.g. upon card renewal). The Account owner will receive a receipt upon each receipt of payment by Zendesk, or they may obtain a receipt from within the Service to track subscription status. Zendesk uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain or use Your billing information except to process Your credit card information for Zendesk. 8. CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION 8.1 Either You or Zendesk may elect to terminate Your Account and subscription to the Service as of the end of your then current Subscription Term by providing notice, in accordance with these Terms, on or prior to the date thirty (30) days preceding the end of such Subscription Term. Unless Your Account and subscription to the Service is so terminated, Your subscription to the Service will renew for a Subscription Term equivalent in length to the then expiring Subscription Term. Unless otherwise provided for in any Form, the Subscription Charges applicable to Your subscription to the Service for any such subsequent Subscription Term shall be Our standard Subscription Charges for the Service Plan to which You have subscribed as of the time such subsequent Subscription Term commences. 8.2 No refunds or credits for Subscription Charges or other fees or payments will be provided to You if You elect to terminate Your subscription to the Service or cancel Your Account prior to the end of Your then effective Subscription Term. Following the termination or cancellation of Your subscription to the Service and/or Account, We reserve the right to delete all Your Data in the normal course of operation. Your Data cannot be recovered once Your Account is cancelled. 8.3 If You terminate Your subscription to the Service or cancel Your Account prior to the end of Your then effective Subscription Term or We effect such termination or cancellation pursuant to Section 2.5(c) or 8.4, in addition to other amounts You may owe Zendesk, You must immediately pay any then unpaid Subscription Charges associated with the remainder of such Subscription Term. This amount will not be payable by You in the event You terminate Your subscription to the Service or cancel Your Account as a result of a material breach of these Terms by Zendesk, provided that You provide advance notice of such breach to Zendesk and afford Zendesk not less than thirty (30) days to reasonably cure such breach. 8.4 Zendesk reserves the right to modify, suspend or terminate the Service (or any part thereof), Your Account or Your and/or Agents or End Users rights to access and use the Service, and remove, disable and discard any of Your Data if We believe that You, Agents or End Users have violated these Terms. This includes the removal or disablement of Your Data in accordance with Our Copyright Infringement Notice and Takedown Policy available at Unless legally prohibited from doing so, Zendesk will use commercially reasonable efforts to contact You directly via email to notify You when taking any of the foregoing actions. Zendesk shall not be liable to You, Agents, End Users or any other third party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuation of Your rights to access and use the Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity by You, Agents or End Users may be referred to law enforcement authorities at Our sole discretion. 9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES THE SITE AND THE SERVICE, INCLUDING ALL SERVER AND NETWORK COMPONENTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN AS IS AND AS AVAILABLE BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AND ZENDESK EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ZENDESK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR-FREE OR FREE FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS SOFTWARE, AND NO INFORMATION OR ADVICE OBTAINED BY YOU FROM ZENDESK OR THROUGH THE SERVICE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. 10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 10.1 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) WILL EITHER PARTY TO THESE TERMS, OR THEIR AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST SALES OR BUSINESS, LOST DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER LOSS INCURRED BY SUCH PARTY OR THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OR COULD HAVE FORESEEN SUCH DAMAGES. 10.2 NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THESE TERMS, ZENDESKS AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUBSCRIPTION TO, OR USE OR EMPLOYMENT OF THE SERVICE, SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE SUBSCRIPTION CHARGES PAID BY YOU DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE FIRST EVENT OR OCCURRENCE GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THIS SECTION 10.2 IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND LIMIT POTENTIAL LIABILITY GIVEN THE SUBSCRIPTION CHARGES, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IF ZENDESK WERE TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER LIABILITY OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH HEREIN. ZENDESK HAS RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO PROVIDE YOU THE RIGHTS TO ACCESS AND USE THE SERVICE PROVIDED FOR IN THESE TERMS. 10.3 Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply to You. IN THESE JURISDICTIONS, ZENDESKS LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 11. INDEMNIFICATION 11.1 Zendesk will indemnify and hold You harmless, from and against any claim against You by reason of Your use of the Service as permitted hereunder, brought by a third party alleging that the Service infringes or misappropriates a third partys valid patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret (an IP Claim). Zendesk shall, at its expense, defend such IP Claim and pay damages finally awarded against You in connection therewith, including the reasonable fees and expenses of the attorneys engaged by Zendesk for such defense, provided that (a) You promptly notify Zendesk of the threat or notice of such IP Claim, (b) Zendesk will have the sole and exclusive control and authority to select defense attorneys, defend and/or settle any such IP Claim, and (c) You fully cooperate with Zendesk in connection therewith. If use of the Service by You, Agents or End Users has become, or in Zendesks opinion is likely to become, the subject of any such IP Claim, Zendesk may at its option and expense (a) procure for You the right to continue using the Service as set forth hereunder; (b) replace or modify the Service to make it non-infringing; or (c) if options (a) or (b) are not commercially and reasonably practicable as determined by Zendesk, terminate Your subscription to the Service and repay You, on a pro-rated basis, any Subscription Charges previously paid to Zendesk for the corresponding unused portion of Your Subscription Term. Zendesk will have no liability or obligation under this Section 11.1 with respect to any IP Claim if such claim is caused in whole or in part by (i) compliance with designs, data, instructions or specifications provided by You; (ii) modification of the Service by anyone other than Zendesk; or (iii) the combination, operation or use of the Service with other hardware or software where the Service would not by itself be infringing. The provisions of this Section 11.1 state the sole, exclusive and entire liability of Zendesk to You and constitute Your sole remedy with respect to an IP Claim brought by reason of access to or use of the Service by You, Agents or End Users. 11.2 You will indemnify and hold Zendesk harmless against any claim brought by a third party against Zendesk arising from or related to use of the Service by You, Agents or End Users in breach of these Terms or matters which You have expressly agreed to be responsible pursuant to these Terms; provided that Zendesk promptly notifies You of the threat or notice of such a claim. 12. ASSIGNMENT; ENTIRE AGREEMENT; REVISIONS 12.1 You may not, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, assign all or any part of these Terms or Your rights under these Terms or delegate performance of Your duties under these Terms without Zendesks prior consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. We may, without Your consent, assign Our agreement with You to any affiliate or in connection with any merger or change of control of Zendesk or the sale of all or substantially all of Our assets provided that any such successor agrees to fulfill its obligations pursuant to these Terms. Subject to the foregoing restrictions, these Terms will be fully binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 12.2 These Terms, together with any Form(s), constitute the entire agreement, and supersede any and all prior agreements between You and Zendesk with regard to the subject matter hereof. We may amend these Terms from time to time, in which case the new Terms will supersede prior versions. We will notify You not less than ten (10) days prior to the effective date of any such amendment and Your continued use of the Service following the effective date of any such amendment may be relied upon by Zendesk as Your consent to any such amendment. Zendesks failure to enforce at any time any provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision or of any other provision of the Terms. 13. SEVERABILITY If any provision in these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as to best accomplish the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in effect. 14. EXPORT COMPLIANCE AND USE RESTRICTIONS The Service and other Software or components of the Service which Zendesk may provide or make available to You, Agents or End Users may be subject to U.S. export control and economic sanctions laws.

RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES The parties are independent contractors. These Terms do not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship among the parties. 16. SURVIVAL Sections 1, 3, 4 and 9-19 shall survive any termination of our agreement with respect to use of the Service by You, Agents or End Users. Termination of such agreement shall not limit Your or Zendesks liability for obligations accrued as of or prior to such termination or for any breach of these Terms. 17.

VOICE FUNCTIONALITY If Your Service Plan and subscription to the Service allows You to use the Zendesk Voice™ service, You understand and agree that (a) the Service is not intended to support or carry emergency calls to any emergency services such as public safety answering points, (b) Zendesk will not be held liable for any claim, damages or loss (and You hereby waive any and all such claims or causes of action), arising from or relating to Your (or Agents or End Users) inability to use the Service to make such emergency calls, (c) You are solely responsible for Your operation of Zendesk Voice in compliance with all applicable laws in all jurisdictions governing use of the Service by You, Agents and End Users, including but not limited to telephone recording and wiretapping laws, and (d) You will defend, hold harmless and indemnify Zendesk from and against any third party claim arising from any of the foregoing. Zendesk may disable the phone numbers provided to You if unused or substantially underused for sixty (60) days, or if Your subscription to the Service, Account or rights to access and/or use the Service is otherwise suspended, terminated, or cancelled. Use of Zendesk Voice is subject to the payment of additional fees and charges, including, without limitation, the phone call rates as detailed on the Site. When enabling Zendesk Voice, You are consenting, on behalf of You and Your Agents and End-Users to the Processing of Your Data (as generated by or necessary for the provision or operation of Zendesk Voice) by the third party service provider we utilize to provide Zendesk Voice. 7. BILLING, PLAN MODIFICATIONS AND PAYMENTS 7.1 Unless otherwise indicated on a Form referencing these Terms and subject to Section 7.2, all charges associated with Your access to and use of the Service (“Subscription Charges”) are due in full upon commencement of Your Subscription Term. Subscription Charges for Zendesk Voice may be charged in arrears or, at Our election, by requiring You to prepay for expected usage. If You fail to pay Your Subscription Charges or charges for other services indicated on any Form referencing these Terms within five (5) business days of Our notice to You that payment is due or delinquent, or if You do not update payment information upon Our request, in addition to Our other remedies, We may suspend or terminate access to and use of the Service by You, Agents and End Users. 7.2 If You choose to upgrade Your Service Plan or increase the number of authorized Agents during Your Subscription Term (a “Subscription Upgrade”), any incremental Subscription Charges associated with such Subscription Upgrade will be prorated over the remaining period of Your then current Subscription Term, charged to Your Account and due and payable upon implementation of such Subscription Upgrade. In any future Subscription Term, Your Subscription Charges will reflect any such Subscription Upgrades. 7.3 No refunds or credits for Subscription Charges or other fees or payments will be provided to You if You elect to downgrade Your Service Plan. Downgrading Your Service Plan may cause loss of content, features, or capacity of the Service as available to You under Your Account, and Zendesk does not accept any liability for such loss. Zendesk reserves the right to contact You about special pricing if You maintain an exceptionally high number of End Users, an unusually high monthly ticket ratio per Agent, an unusually high level of open tickets or other excessive stress on the Service. 7.4 Unless otherwise stated, Our charges do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes assessable by any local, state, provincial or foreign jurisdiction (collectively “Taxes”). You are responsible for paying Taxes except those assessable against Zendesk based on its income. We will invoice You for such Taxes if We believe We have a legal obligation to do so and You agree to pay such Taxes if so invoiced. 7.5 If You pay by credit card or certain other payment instruments, the Service provides an interface for the Account owner to change credit card information (e.g. upon card renewal). The Account owner will receive a receipt upon each receipt of payment by the Zendesk Payment Agent, or they may obtain a receipt from within the Service to track subscription status. You hereby authorize the Zendesk Payment Agent to bill Your credit card or other payment instrument in advance on a periodic basis in accordance with the terms of the Service Plan until You terminate Your Subscription, and You further agree to pay any Subscription Charges so incurred. Zendesk and the Zendesk Payment Agent use a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain or use Your billing information except to process Your credit card information for Zendesk and the Zendesk Payment Agent. 8. CREDITS POLICY 8.1 Zendesk may choose to offer credits in regards to some or all of the Service. Credits may be accumulated by You in various ways, including but not limited to, Your redemption of coupons; awarded via promotional campaigns; and referrals. Zendesk reserves the right to award credits at its sole discretion. Credits have no monetary or cash value and can only be used by You to offset Your subsequent payments of Subscription Charges. Credits may only be applied to Subscription Charges due for the Service specifically identified by Zendesk when issuing the credit. Credits can only be used by You and are non-transferable. 8.2 To the extent that You have been awarded credits, unless the instrument (including any coupon) states an earlier expiration date, these credits shall expire and no longer be redeemable twelve (12) months from the date the credit was issued. 9. CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION 9.1 Either You or Zendesk may elect to terminate Your Account and subscription to the Services as of the end of Your then current Subscription Term by providing notice, in accordance with these Terms, on or prior to the date thirty (30) days preceding the end of such Subscription Term. Unless Your Account and subscription to the Service is so terminated, Your subscription to the Service will renew for a Subscription Term equivalent in length to the then expiring Subscription Term. Unless otherwise provided for in any Form, the Subscription Charges applicable to Your subscription to the Service for any such subsequent Subscription Term shall be Our standard Subscription Charges for the Service Plan to which You have subscribed as of the time such subsequent Subscription Term commences. 9.2 No refunds or credits for Subscription Charges or other fees or payments will be provided to You if You elect to terminate Your subscription to the Service or cancel Your Account prior to the end of Your then effective Subscription Term. Following the termination or cancellation of Your subscription to the Service and/or Account, We reserve the right to delete all Your Data in the normal course of operation. Your Data cannot be recovered once Your Account is cancelled. 9.3 If You terminate Your subscription to the Service or cancel Your Account prior to the end of Your then effective Subscription Term or We effect such termination or cancellation pursuant to Sections 2.5(c) or 9.4, in addition to other amounts You may owe Zendesk, You must immediately pay any then unpaid Subscription Charges associated with the remainder of such Subscription Term. This amount will not be payable by You in the event You terminate Your subscription to the Service or cancel Your Account as a result of a material breach of these Terms by Zendesk, provided that You provide advance notice of such breach to Zendesk and afford Zendesk not less than thirty (30) days to reasonably cure such breach. 9.4 Zendesk reserves the right to modify, suspend or terminate the Service (or any part thereof), Your Account or Your and/or Agents’ or End Users’ rights to access and use the Service, and remove, disable and discard any of Your Data if We believe that You, Agents or End Users have violated these Terms. This includes the removal or disablement of Your Data in accordance with Our Copyright Infringement Notice and Takedown Policy available at Unless legally prohibited from doing so, Zendesk will use commercially reasonable efforts to contact You directly via email to notify You when taking any of the foregoing actions. Zendesk shall not be liable to You, Agents, End Users or any other third party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuation of Your rights to access and use the Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity by You, Agents or End Users may be referred to law enforcement authorities at Our sole discretion. 10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES THE SITE AND THE SERVICE, INCLUDING ALL SERVER AND NETWORK COMPONENTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AND ZENDESK EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ZENDESK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR-FREE OR FREE FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS SOFTWARE, AND NO INFORMATION OR ADVICE OBTAINED BY YOU FROM ZENDESK OR THROUGH THE SERVICE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. 11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 11.1 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) WILL EITHER PARTY TO THESE TERMS, OR THEIR AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST SALES OR BUSINESS, LOST DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER LOSS INCURRED BY SUCH PARTY OR THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OR COULD HAVE FORESEEN SUCH DAMAGES. 11.2 NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THESE TERMS, ZENDESK’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUBSCRIPTION TO, OR USE OR EMPLOYMENT OF THE SERVICE, SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE SUBSCRIPTION CHARGES PAID BY YOU DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE FIRST EVENT OR OCCURRENCE GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THIS SECTION 11.2 IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND LIMIT POTENTIAL LIABILITY GIVEN THE SUBSCRIPTION CHARGES, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IF ZENDESK WERE TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER LIABILITY OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH HEREIN. ZENDESK HAS RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO PROVIDE YOU THE RIGHTS TO ACCESS AND USE THE SERVICE PROVIDED FOR IN THESE TERMS. 11.3 Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply to You. IN THESE JURISDICTIONS, ZENDESK’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 12. INDEMNIFICATION 12.1 Zendesk will indemnify and hold You harmless, from and against any claim against You by reason of Your use of the Service as permitted hereunder, brought by a third party alleging that the Service infringes or misappropriates a third party’s valid patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret (an “IP Claim”). Zendesk shall, at its expense, defend such IP Claim and pay damages finally awarded against You in connection therewith, including the reasonable fees and expenses of the attorneys engaged by Zendesk for such defense, provided that (a) You promptly notify Zendesk of the threat or notice of such IP Claim; (b) Zendesk will have the sole and exclusive control and authority to select defense attorneys, defend and/or settle any such IP Claim; and (c) You fully cooperate with Zendesk in connection therewith. If use of the Services by You, Agents or End Users has become, or in Zendesk’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of any such IP Claim, Zendesk may at its option and expense (a) procure for You the right to continue using the Service as set forth hereunder; (b) replace or modify the Service to make it non-infringing; or (c) if options (a) or (b) are not commercially and reasonably practicable as determined by Zendesk, terminate Your subscription to the Services and repay You, on a pro-rated basis, any Subscription Charges previously paid to Zendesk for the corresponding unused portion of Your Subscription Term. Zendesk will have no liability or obligation under this Section 12.1 with respect to any IP Claim if such claim is caused in whole or in part by (i) compliance with designs, data, instructions or specifications provided by You; (ii) modification of the Service by anyone other than Zendesk; or (iii) the combination, operation or use of the Services with other hardware or software where the Services would not by itself be infringing. The provisions of this Section 12.1 state the sole, exclusive and entire liability of Zendesk to You and constitute Your sole remedy with respect to an IP Claim brought by reason of access to or use of the Service by You, Agents or End Users. 12.2 You will indemnify and hold Zendesk harmless against any claim brought by a third party against Zendesk arising from or related to use of the Service by You, Agents or End Users in breach of these Terms or matters which You have expressly agreed to be responsible pursuant to these Terms; provided that Zendesk promptly notifies You of the threat or notice of such a claim. 13. ASSIGNMENT; ENTIRE AGREEMENT; REVISIONS 13.1 You may not, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, assign all or any part of these Terms or Your rights under these Terms or delegate performance of Your duties under these Terms without Zendesk’s prior consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. We may, without Your consent, assign Our agreement with You to any member of the Zendesk Group or in connection with any merger or change of control of Zendesk or the sale of all or substantially all of Our assets provided that any such successor agrees to fulfill its obligations pursuant to these Terms. Subject to the foregoing restrictions, these Terms will be fully binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 13.2 These Terms, together with any Form(s), constitute the entire agreement, and supersede any and all prior agreements between You and Zendesk with regard to the subject matter hereof. These Terms and any Form(s) shall apply in lieu of the terms or conditions in any purchase order or other order documentation You or any Entity which You represent provides (all such terms or conditions being null and void), and, except as expressly stated herein, there are no other agreements, representations, warranties, or commitments which may be relied upon by either party with respect to the subject matter hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, additional terms may apply to certain features or functionality Zendesk offers through the Services (the “Additional Terms”). In those instances, Zendesk will notify You of such Additional Terms prior to the activation of these features or functionality and the activation of these features or functionality in Your Account will be considered acceptance of the Additional Terms. All such Additional Terms will be considered incorporated into these Terms when You or any Agent authorized as an administrator in Your Account activate the feature or functionality. Where there is a conflict between these Terms and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control. 13.3 We may amend these Terms from time to time, in which case the new Terms will supersede prior versions. We will notify You not less than ten (10) days prior to the effective date of any such amendment and Your continued use of the Service following the effective date of any such amendment may be relied upon by Zendesk as Your consent to any such amendment. Zendesk’s failure to enforce at any time any provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision or of any other provision of the Terms. 14. SEVERABILITY If any provision in these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as to best accomplish the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in effect. 15. EXPORT COMPLIANCE AND USE RESTRICTIONS The Service and other Software or components of the Service which Zendesk may provide or make available to You, Agents or End Users may be subject to U.S. export control and economic sanctions laws. You agree to comply with all such laws and regulations as they relate to access to and use of the Service, Software and such other components by You, Agents and End Users. You shall not access or use the Service if You are located in any jurisdiction in which the provision of the Service, Software or other components is prohibited under U.S. or other applicable laws or regulations (a “Prohibited Jurisdiction”) and You shall not provide access to the Service to any government, entity or individual located in any Prohibited Jurisdiction.

RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES The parties are independent contractors. These Terms do not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship among the parties. 17. SURVIVAL Sections 1, 3, 4 and 9-19 shall survive any termination of our agreement with respect to use of the Service by You, Agents or End Users. Termination of such agreement shall not limit Your or Zendesk’s liability for obligations accrued as of or prior to such termination or for any breach of these Terms. 18. CONTRACTING PARTY Payments made by credit card, debit card or certain other payment instruments are billed and processed by Zendesk if denominated in U.S. dollars and by Zendesk International Ltd. if denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent that any such entity billing or processing this transaction (the “Billing Entity”) is not Zendesk, the Billing Entity is acting solely as a billing and processing agent for and on behalf of Zendesk and shall not be construed to be providing the Service. You are contracting with and the Service is provided and delivered by Zendesk. 19.

DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY; CONFIDENTIALITY 3.1 Subject to the express permissions of these Terms, each Party will protect each other’s Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access or disclosure in the same manner as each protects its own Confidential Information, but with no less than reasonable care. Except as otherwise expressly permitted pursuant to these Terms, each of us may use each other’s Confidential Information solely to exercise our respective rights and perform our respective obligations under these Terms and shall disclose such Confidential Information (a) solely to those of our respective employees, representatives, subcontractors and agents who have a need to know such Confidential Information for such purposes and who are bound to maintain the confidentiality of, and not misuse, such Confidential Information; (b) as necessary to comply with an order or subpoena of any administrative agency or court of competent jurisdiction; or (c) as reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law or regulation.

These safeguards include encryption of Service Data in transmission (using TLS or similar technologies), except for certain Other Services that do not support encryption, which You may link to through the Service at Your election. Our compliance with the provisions of this Section 3.3 shall be deemed compliance with Our obligations to protect Service Data as set forth in Section 3.1. 3.4 You agree that We and the service providers that We utilize to assist in providing the Service to You shall have the right to access Your Account and to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, display and disclose Service Data to the extent necessary to provide the Service, including, without limitation, in response to Your support requests.

We use, disclose, and protect this information as described in Our Privacy Policy, the then-current version of which is available at and is incorporated into the Terms. 3.6 Unless otherwise specifically agreed to by the Zendesk Contracting Party, Service Data may be hosted or otherwise Processed by the Zendesk Contracting Party, an Affiliate within the Zendesk Group, or their respective authorized service partners in the U.S., the EEA or other locations around the world.

You may be required to register for or log into such Other Services on their respective websites. By enabling any Other Services, You are expressly permitting the Zendesk Contracting Party to disclose Your Login as well as Service Data as necessary to facilitate the use or enablement of such Other Services. 6. VOICE FUNCTIONALITY If Your Service Plan for the Zendesk Service allows You to use the Zendesk Voice™ service or You otherwise utilize Zendesk Voice as an Deployed Associated Service, You understand and agree that (a) neither Zendesk Voice nor any Service is intended to support or carry emergency calls to any emergency services such as public safety answering points; (b) We will not be held liable for any claim, damages or loss (and You hereby waive any and all such claims or causes of action), arising from or relating to Your (or Agents or End-Users) inability to use the Zendesk Voice or any Service to make such emergency calls; (c) You are solely responsible for Your operation of Zendesk Voice in compliance with all applicable laws in all jurisdictions, including but not limited to telephone recording and wiretapping laws; and (d) You will defend, hold harmless and indemnify Us from and against any third party claim arising from any of the foregoing. Zendesk may disable the phone numbers provided to You if unused or substantially underused for sixty (60) days, or if Your subscription to the Service, Account or rights to access and/or use the Service is otherwise suspended, terminated, or cancelled. Use of Zendesk Voice is subject to the payment of additional fees and charges, including, without limitation, the phone call rates as detailed on the Site applicable to the Zendesk Service. 7. BILLING, PLAN MODIFICATIONS AND PAYMENTS 7.1 Unless otherwise indicated on a Form referencing these Terms or in any Additional Terms (as defined in Section 13.2) and subject to Section 7.2, all charges associated with Your access to and use of the Service (“Subscription Charges”) are due in full upon commencement of Your Subscription Term, or with respect to a Deployed Associated Service, at the time such Deployed Associated Service is purchased, subscribed to or otherwise deployed. At Our election, Subscription Charges for Zendesk Voice may be charged in arrears or by requiring You to prepay for expected usage. If You fail to pay Your Subscription Charges or charges for other services indicated on any Form referencing these Terms within five (5) business days of Our notice to You that payment is due or delinquent, or if You do not update payment information upon Our request, in addition to Our other remedies, We may suspend or terminate access to and use of such Service by You, Agents and End-Users. 7.2 If You choose to upgrade Your Service Plan or increase the number of Agents authorized to access and use the Service during Your Subscription Term (a “Subscription Upgrade”), any incremental Subscription Charges associated with such Subscription Upgrade will be prorated over the remaining period of Your then current Subscription Term, charged to Your Account and due and payable upon implementation of such Subscription Upgrade. In any future Subscription Term, Your Subscription Charges will reflect any such Subscription Upgrades. 7.3 No refunds or credits for Subscription Charges or other fees or payments will be provided to You if You elect to downgrade Your Service Plan. Downgrading Your Service Plan may cause loss of content, features, or capacity of the Service as available to You under Your Account, and the Zendesk Contracting Party does not accept any liability for such loss. 7.4 Unless otherwise stated, Our charges do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes assessable by any local, state, provincial or foreign jurisdiction (collectively “Taxes”). You are responsible for paying Taxes except those assessable against the Zendesk Contracting Party based on its income. We will invoice You for such Taxes if We believe We have a legal obligation to do so and You agree to pay such Taxes if so invoiced. 7.5 If You pay by credit card or certain other payment instruments, the Service provides an interface for the Account owner to change credit card information (e.g. upon card renewal). The Account owner will receive a receipt upon each receipt of payment by the Payment Agent, or they may obtain a receipt from within the Service to track subscription status. You hereby authorize the Payment Agent to bill Your credit card or other payment instrument in advance on a periodic basis in accordance with the terms of the Service Plan for the Service and for periodic Subscription Charges applicable to Deployed Associated Services until You terminate Your Subscription to the Service, and You further agree to pay any Subscription Charges so incurred. In addition, to the extent that You have or are required to prepay for expected usage of Zendesk Voice, Your credit balance will automatically be recharged with the same amount and by the same payment method chosen when You first establish a prepaid credit for Zendesk Voice, or by such additional amount You request as a regular prepaid credit. If applicable, You hereby authorize the Zendesk Contracting Party and the Payment Agent to charge Your credit card or other payment instrument to establish such prepaid credit. You agree to promptly update your Account information with any changes (for example, a change in Your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur. The Payment Agent uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain or use Your billing information except to process Your credit card information for the Payment Agent. 8. CREDITS POLICY 8.1 We may, at our sole discretion, choose to offer credits for the Service in various ways, including but not limited to, coupons, promotional campaigns and referrals. The Zendesk Contracting Party reserves the right to award credits at its sole discretion. Credits have no monetary or cash value and can only be used by You to offset Your subsequent payments of Subscription Charges for the applicable Service. Credits may only be applied to Subscription Charges due for the Service specifically identified by the Zendesk Contracting Party when issuing the credit. Credits can only be used by You and are non-transferable. 8.2 To the extent that You have been awarded Zendesk credits, unless the instrument (including any coupon) states an earlier expiration date, these Zendesk credits shall expire and no longer be redeemable twelve (12) months from the date the Zendesk credit was issued. To the extent that You have been awarded Zopim credits, unless the instrument (including any coupon) states an earlier expiration date, these Zopim credits shall expire and no longer be redeemable upon twelve (12) months from the Zopim credit last activity (i.e., Zopim credit issuance or Zopim credit usage). 9. CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION 9.1 Either Party may elect to terminate Your Account and subscription to the Service as of the end of Your then current Subscription Term by providing notice, in accordance with these Terms, on or prior to the date thirty (30) days preceding the end of such Subscription Term. Unless Your Account and subscription to the Services is so terminated, Your subscription to the Service (including any and all Deployed Associated Services) will renew for a Subscription Term equivalent in length to the then expiring Subscription Term. Unless otherwise provided for in any Form, the Subscription Charges applicable to Your subscription to the Service for any such subsequent Subscription Term shall be Our standard Subscription Charges for the Service Plan and Deployed Associated Services to which You have subscribed or which you have deployed, as applicable, as of the time such subsequent Subscription Term commences. 9.2 No refunds or credits for Subscription Charges or other fees or payments will be provided to You if You elect to terminate Your subscription to the Service or cancel Your Account prior to the end of Your then effective Subscription Term. Following the termination or cancellation of Your subscription to the Service and/or Account, We reserve the right to delete all Service Data in the normal course of operation. Service Data cannot be recovered once Your Account is cancelled. 9.3 If You terminate Your subscription to the Service or cancel Your Account prior to the end of Your then effective Subscription Term or We effect such termination or cancellation pursuant to Sections 2.5(c) or 9.4, in addition to other amounts You may owe Zendesk, You must immediately pay any then unpaid Subscription Charges associated with the remainder of such Subscription Term. This amount will not be payable by You in the event You terminate Your subscription to the Service or cancel Your Account as a result of a material breach of these Terms by the Zendesk Contracting Party, provided that You provide advance notice of such breach to the Zendesk Contracting Party and afford the Zendesk Contracting Party not less than thirty (30) days to reasonably cure such breach. 9.4 We reserve the right to modify, suspend or terminate the Service (or any part thereof), Your Account or Your and/or Agents’ or End-Users’ rights to access and use the Services, and remove, disable and discard any Service Data if We believe that You, Agents or End-Users have violated these Terms.

WE HAVE RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO PROVIDE YOU THE RIGHTS TO ACCESS AND USE THE SERVICE PROVIDED FOR IN THESE TERMS. 11.3 Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply to You. IN THESE JURISDICTIONS, THE ZENDESK CONTRACTING PARTY’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 11.4 Any claims or damages that You may have against the Zendesk Contracting Party shall only be enforceable against the Zendesk Contracting Party and not any other entity or its officers, directors, representatives or agents. 12. INDEMNIFICATION 12.1 We will indemnify and hold You harmless, from and against any claim against You by reason of Your use of the Service as permitted hereunder, brought by a third party alleging that such Service infringes or misappropriates a third party’s valid patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret (an “IP Claim”). We shall, at Our expense, defend such IP Claim and pay damages finally awarded against You in connection therewith, including the reasonable fees and expenses of the attorneys engaged by the Zendesk Contracting Party for such defense, provided that (a) You promptly notify the Zendesk Contracting Party of the threat or notice of such IP Claim; (b) We will have the sole and exclusive control and authority to select defense attorneys, defend and/or settle any such IP Claim; and (c) You fully cooperate with the Zendesk Contracting Party in connection therewith. If use of the Service by You, Agents or End-Users has become, or in Our opinion is likely to become, the subject of any such IP Claim, We may at its option and expense (a) procure for You the right to continue using the Service as set forth hereunder; (b) replace or modify the Service to make it non-infringing; or (c) if options (a) or (b) are not commercially reasonable or practicable as determined by the Zendesk Contracting Party, terminate Your subscription to the Service and repay You, on a pro-rated basis, any Subscription Charges previously paid to the Zendesk Contracting Party for the corresponding unused portion of Your Subscription Term for such Service. We will have no liability or obligation under this Section 12.1 with respect to any IP Claim if such claim is caused in whole or in part by (i) compliance with designs, data, instructions or specifications provided by You; (ii) modification of the Service by anyone other than the Zendesk Contracting Party; or (iii) the combination, operation or use of the Service with other hardware or software where the Service would not by itself be infringing. The provisions of this Section 12.1 state the sole, exclusive and entire liability of the Zendesk Contracting Party to You and constitute Your sole remedy with respect to an IP Claim brought by reason of access to or use of the Service by You, Agents or End-Users. 12.2 You will indemnify and hold the Zendesk Contracting Party harmless against any claim brought by a third party against Zendesk arising from or related to use of the Service by You, Agents or End-Users in breach of these Terms or matters which You have expressly agreed to be responsible pursuant to these Terms; provided that We promptly notifies You of the threat or notice of such a claim. 13. ASSIGNMENT; ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENT 13.1 You may not, directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, assign all or any part of these Terms or Your rights under these Terms or delegate performance of Your duties under these Terms without Our prior consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. We may, without Your consent, assign Our agreement with You to any member of the Zendesk Group or in connection with any merger or change of control of the Zendesk Contracting Party or the Zendesk Group or the sale of all or substantially all of Our assets provided that any such successor agrees to fulfill its obligations pursuant to these Terms. Subject to the foregoing restrictions, these Terms will be fully binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 13.2 These Terms, together with any Form(s), constitute the entire agreement, and supersede any and all prior agreements between You and the Zendesk Contracting Party with regard to the subject matter hereof. These Terms and any Form(s) shall apply in lieu of the terms or conditions in any purchase order or other order documentation You or any Entity which You represent provides (all such terms or conditions being null and void), and, except as expressly stated herein, there are no other agreements, representations, warranties, or commitments which may be relied upon by either party with respect to the subject matter hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, additional terms may apply to certain features, functionality, or services We offer as part of or distinct from the Service, including Associated Services (the “Additional Terms”). In those instances, We will notify You of such Additional Terms prior to the activation of these features, functionality, or services and the activation of these features, functionality, or services in Your Account will be considered acceptance of the Additional Terms. All such Additional Terms will be considered incorporated into these Terms when You or any Agent authorized as an administrator in Your Account activate the feature, functionality, or service. Where there is a conflict between these Terms and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control. 13.3 We may amend these Terms from time to time, in which case the new Terms will supersede prior versions. We will notify You not less than ten (10) days prior to the effective date of any such amendment and Your continued use of the Service following the effective date of any such amendment may be relied upon by Zendesk as Your consent to any such amendment. Our failure to enforce at any time any provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision or of any other provision of the Terms. 14. SEVERABILITY If any provision in these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as to best accomplish the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in effect. 15. EXPORT COMPLIANCE AND USE RESTRICTIONS The Service and other Software or components of the Service that We may provide or make available to You, Agents or End-Users may be subject to U.S. export control and economic sanctions laws. You agree to comply with all such laws and regulations as they relate to access to and use of the Service, Software and such other components by You, Agents and End-Users.

These Terms do not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship among the parties. 17. SURVIVAL Sections 1, 2.3, 3, 4 and 9-21 shall survive any termination of our agreement with respect to use of the Service by You, Agents or End Users. Termination of such agreement shall not limit a Party’s liability for obligations accrued as of or prior to such termination or for any breach of these Terms. 18.

Protection of Information Zendesk is committed to ensuring the security of your personal information. We utilize robust precautions to protect the confidentiality and security of the personal information within the Service, by employing technological, physical and administrative security safeguards, such as firewalls and carefully developed security procedures. For example, when you enter confidential information (such as login credentials or information submitted from within the Service) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). These technologies, procedures and other measures are used in an effort to ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you authorized to access your data. However, no internet, e-mail or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take care in deciding what information you send to us in this way. Safe Harbor Data Privacy Notice Zendesk has certified compliance with the U.S. – EU and U.S. – Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks for protecting the privacy of data flowing from the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland to the United States, as set forth by the US Department of Commerce. Zendesk and the other entities that comprise the Zendesk Group are committed to adherence to the principles set forth in these frameworks regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from EU member countries and Switzerland as well as related principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement. We frequently enter agreements with our customers located in the EEA to provide them access to our Service, which includes the processing of information relating their customers. In providing our Service, we do not own, control or direct the use of the information stored or processed on our platform at the direction of our customers, and in fact we are largely unaware of what information is being stored on our platform and only access such information as reasonably necessary to provide the Service (including to respond to support requests), as otherwise authorized by our customers or as required by law. We are the data processors and not the data controllers of the information on our platform for purposes of the EU Directive on Data Protection (Directive) and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection. Our EEA or Switzerland based customers, who control their customer data and send it to Zendesk for processing, are the “controllers” of that data and are responsible for compliance with the Directive. In particular, Zendesk’s customers are responsible for complying with the Directive and relevant data protection legislation in the relevant EEA member state before sending personal information to Zendesk for processing. We work with our customers to help them provide notice to their customers concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected. As the processors of personal information on behalf of our customers, we follow their instructions with respect to the information they control to the extent consistent with the functionality of our Service. In doing so, we implement technical, physical and administrative measures against unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of, or damage to, personal information as more fully described above under the section above entitled, “Protection of Information”.

Requests to opt-out of transfers to our third-party vendors may also be submitted, but limitations on data sharing may make it difficult or impossible to provide the Service in this manner.

To review our updated policy, click here. Effective as of May 1, 2014. At Zendesk, we respect and protect the privacy of visitors to our website, together with the other websites that Zendesk, Inc. operates (collectively, the Zendesk Websites), and our customers who use our on-demand customer service support platform, tools and services offered on the Zendesk Websites (together with the Zendesk Websites, the Service). This Privacy Policy (Policy) explains how we collect and use visitors and customers information, particularly personal information, as part of the Service. The information Zendesk collects and uses is limited to the purpose for which customers engage Zendesk and other purposes expressly described in this Policy. Any discussion of your use of the Service in this Policy is meant to include your visits and other interactions with the Zendesk Websites, whether or not you are a user of Zendesks on-demand customer service support platform. Capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy and not defined herein shall have the meaning attributed to them in our Terms of Service. Privacy Certifications To mark its commitment to privacy, Zendesk has entered into a number of voluntary data privacy programs, including the TRUSTe® Privacy Certification Programs, and the United States  European Union and the US-Swiss Safe Harbor programs. We have received TRUSTe’s Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy statement and our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program viewable on the validation page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal. Zendesk also complies with the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from EU member countries and Switzerland. We have certified our adherence to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement.

If you are not satisfied with our response or we do not respond to your query within 30 days, you can contact TRUSTe here. What do we mean by Personal Information? In this Policy, personal information means information or an information set that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of Zendesk to identify an individual and includes Personal Data as such term is defined in our Terms. Except as described in this Policy, Zendesk will not give, sell, rent or loan any personal information to any third party. Personal information does not include Usage Data which we define as encoded or anonymized information or aggregated data we collect about a group or category of services, features or users which does not contain personally identifying information. Usage Data helps us understand trends in usage of the Service so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor the Service. In addition to collecting and using Usage Data ourselves, we may share Usage Data with third parties, including our customers, partners and service providers, for various purposes, including to help us better understand our customers needs and improve the Service as well as for advertising and marketing purposes. We do not share Usage Data with third parties in a way that would enable them to identify you personally. How Do We Collect, Use and Share Your Personal Information and Other Information? Information You Provide to Us When you register for the Service, we ask for personal information such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address and credit card information, as well as certain related information like your company name and website name. We also collect personal information such as an email address and a name or alias of any agents or end users you authorize to log into and utilize the Service in connection with your account and a password from these Agents when they first access the service. If you sign-up for a 30-day free trial account, you are not required to enter your credit card information unless and until you decide to continue with a paid subscription to the Service. Zendesk uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information for any purpose except for credit card processing on Zendesks behalf. Zendesk may use the personal information provided to operate the Service and tailor its customers needs, for billing, identification and authentication, to contact and communicate with you and your Agents about the Service and your and their use of the Service, send marketing materials (subject to your opt-out option), for research purposes, and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Service. Zendesk may also share personal information with its third-party service providers (such as its credit card processors and hosting partners) to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other services we use to operate the Service and maintain a high quality user experience. We do not permit our service providers to use the personal information we share for their marketing purposes. Log Files As is true with most websites, Zendesk gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes internet protocol addresses as well as browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. Occasionally, we may connect personal information to information gathered in our log files, as necessary to improve the Service for individual customers. Otherwise, we generally use this information as we would any Usage Data, to analyze trends, administer and maintain the Service, or track usage of various features within the Service. Cookies A cookie is a small software file stored temporarily or placed on your computers hard drive. The main purpose of a cookie is to allow a web server to identify a users computer and web browser, and tailor web pages and/or login information to their preferences. Cookies help us promptly display the information needed to use the capabilities of the Service and other information which we consider to be of interest to visitors to the Zendesk Websites and users fo the Service. By gathering and remembering information about website preferences through cookies, we can provide a better web and marketing experience. Cookies dont give us access to users computers, and the information we collect through cookies doesnt include personal information. When your agents or end users use the Service we utilize session cookies, which allow us to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to process your online transactions. Session cookies disappear from your computer when the web browser is closed or computer is turned off. We also utilize persistent cookies to identify Zendesk Agents and End Users and make it easier for them to log into and use the Service. Persistent cookies remain on computers after the web browser is closed or the computer is turned off. We utilize various categories of cookies, which are summarized below along with the options available to you to manage them. Essential: Essential cookies are those that are critical to the functionality of the Service. We use these cookies to keep an agent or end user logged into the Service and remember relevant information when the agent or end user returns to the Service. Functional: We use functional cookies to track agents and end users activities in the Service, understand their preferences and improve their user experience. These cookies can also be used to remember configurations of the Service that our customers can customize. Marketing: We engage third party providers to serve a variety of marketing cookies that enable us to track and analyze usage, navigational and other statistical information from visitors to the Zendesk Websites. This information does not include personal information though we may reassociate this information with personal information we have collected when it is received. Marketing cookies are also used to track the performance of our advertisements and are employed by third party advertising networks that we utilize. These advertising networks follow online activities of visitors to the Zendesk Websites and use this information to inform, optimize and serve tailored advertisements on the Zendesk Websites or on other websites they visit that we believe would most effectively promote the Service to you. We also use third parties to collect information that assists us in other methods of remarketing our Service to visitors to the Zendesk Websites, including customized email communications. You can generally accept or decline the use of cookies through a functionality built into your web browser. To learn more how to control cookie settings through your browser: Click here to learn more about the Private Browsing setting and cookie setting in FireFox; Click here to learn more about Incognito and cookie setting in Chrome; Click here to learn more about InPrivate and cookie setting in Internet Explorer; or Click here to learn more about Private Browsing and cookie setting in Safari. If you want to learn more about cookies, or how to control or delete them, please visit for detailed guidance. In addition, certain third party advertising networks, including Google, permit users to opt out of or customize preferences associated with your internet browsing. To learn more about this feature from Google, click here. Please note that if you do elect to disable your web browsers ability to accept cookies, you may not be able to access or take advantage of many features of the Service. Many jurisdictions require or recommend that website operators inform users as to the nature of cookies they utilize and, in certain circumstances, obtain the consent of their users to the placement of certain cookies. If you are a customer of Zendesk, it is your responsibility to inform the individuals with whom you interact using the Service, including your agents and end users as to the types of cookies utilized in the Service and, as necessary, to obtain their consent. If you require more specific information as to the nature of the cookies utilized in the Service for purposes of fulfilling these obligations, please contact us by email at privacy@zendesk. Web Beacons We also employ web beacons to help us better manage content in the Service by informing us what content is effective. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of internet users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a users computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on websites. We tie the information gathered by web beacons to personal information we otherwise collect, and use them in our HTML-based emails to learn which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns as well as to operate and improve the Service. You can opt-out of these emails by following the unsubscribe instructions within such marketing emails. Do Not Track Signals We do not currently respond to web browsers Do Not Track signals that provide a method to opt out of the collection information about visitors activities on the Zendesk Website and Service, and across other websites. If we do so in the future, we will provide all relevant information in this Policy. Other Information Sharing In addition to the purposes described above, we disclose personal information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. We may share information, including personal information with any member of the Zendesk Group, which includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or under common control with Zendesk, Inc. Links to Other Websites The Service contains links to websites and applications other than the Service, including websites and applications operated by affiliates and other third parties (Third Party). Please be aware that we do not determine and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of websites and applications operated by Third Parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service, and read the privacy statements of Third Party websites and applications linked to the Service. Zendesk does not endorse and is not responsible for the practices of these Third Parties or their websites or applications. This Policy applies only to information collected by the Service. Public Forums The Service (including the Zendesk Websites) offers publicly-accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information provided in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at privacy@zendesk. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. Customer Testimonials/Comments/Reviews From time to time, we post customer testimonials on the Zendesk Websites which may contain personal information. We obtain the customers consent to post their names along with their testimonials. Protection of Information Zendesk is committed to ensuring the security of your personal information. We utilize robust precautions to protect the confidentiality and security of the personal information within the Service, by employing technological, physical and administrative security safeguards, such as firewalls and carefully-developed security procedures. For example, when you enter confidential information (such as login credentials or information submitted from within the Service) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). These technologies, procedures and other measures are used in an effort to ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you authorized to access your data. However, no internet, e-mail or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take care in deciding what information you send to us in this way. Safe Harbor Data Privacy Notice Zendesk complies with the US  EU and US  Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks for protecting the privacy of data flowing from the EU and Switzerland to the United States, as set forth by the US Department of Commerce. We frequently enter agreements with our EU customers to provide them access to our Service, which includes the processing of information relating their customers. In providing our Service, we do not own, control or direct the use of the information stored or processed on our platform at the direction of our customers, and in fact we are largely unaware of what information is being stored on our platform and only access such information as reasonably necessary to provide the Service (including to respond to support requests), as otherwise authorized by our customers or as required by law. We are the data processors and not the data controllers of the information on our platform for purposes of the EU Directive on Data Protection (Directive 95/46/EC) and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection. Our EU or Swiss based customers, who control their customer data and send it to Zendesk for processing, are the controllers of that data and are responsible for compliance with the Directive. In particular, Zendesks customers are responsible for complying with the Directive and relevant data protection legislation in the relevant EU member state before sending personal information to Zendesk for processing. We work with our customers to help them provide notice to their customers concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected. As the processors of personal information on behalf of our customers, we follow their instructions with respect to the information they control to the extent consistent with the functionality of our Service. In doing so, we implement technical, physical and administrative measures against unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of, or damage to, personal information as more fully described above under Protection of Information. Hosting and Data Transfer We are based in the United States, but, unless we expressly agree otherwise (including through our Terms), we may host and process data, including personal information, in the United States and in other countries through the Zendesk Group and third parties that we use to operate and manage the Service. When you access or use the Service, or otherwise provide information to us, you are consenting, on behalf of you and your authorized Agents or End-Users, (and representing that you have the authority to provide such consent) to the processing and transfer of information in and to the United States and other countries which may have different privacy laws from your or their country of residence. Choice We process and store information on behalf of our customers. If you are an individual interacting with a customer of the Service and would no longer like to be contacted by that customer, please contact that customer directly. If you are a Zendesk customer and would like to opt-out of getting marketing communications from Zendesk please contact us at privacy@zendesk or follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each marketing email. Requests to opt-out of transfers to our third-party vendors may also be submitted, but limitations on data sharing may make it difficult or impossible to provide the Service in this manner. Correcting and Updating Your Information Customers may update or change the personal information they have provided Zendesk by logging into the Service and providing such additional information where applicable. If you are our customer and would like to gain access to, or request deletion of information we have collected as data controllers, please contact us at privacy@zendesk. We will respond to such queries within 30 business days. Zendesk has no direct relationship with the individuals with whom our customers may interact using the Service. Any such individual seeking access to, or who would like to correct, amend, or delete data which may be stored in the Service should direct his query to the applicable Zendesk customer acting as the data controller for such information. Data Retention Zendesk will retain personal information we process on behalf of our customers or collect directly from our customers for as long as needed to provide Service to our customers, subject to our compliance with this Policy. We may further retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, maintain accurate accounting, financial and other operational records, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We have established internal policies for the deletion of data from customer accounts following termination of a customers subscription to the Service. Childrens Personal Information Zendesk does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personal information through our Service. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their childrens Internet usage and to help enforce our Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information on our Service without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to Zendesk through our Service, please contact us, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete that information from our databases. Changes to the Privacy Policy If we make any material changes to this Policy, we will notify you by email or by posting a prominent notice on the Zendesk Websites prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your agreement to be bound by such changes to this Policy. Your only remedy, if you do not accept the terms of this Policy, is to discontinue use of the Service. Business Transactions Zendesk may assign or transfer this Policy, and your user account and related information and data, including any personal information, to any person or entity that acquires all or substantially all of the business, stock or assets of, or is merged with.

Otherwise, we generally use this information as we would any Usage Data, to analyze trends, administer and maintain the Service, or track usage of various features within the Service.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch4\\u003eCookies\\u003c/h4\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eA cookie is a small software file stored temporarily or placed on your computers hard drive. The main purpose of a cookie is to allow a web server to identify a users computer and web browser, and tailor web pages and/or login information to their preferences. Cookies help us promptly display the information needed to use the capabilities of the Service and other information which we consider to be of interest to visitors to the Zendesk Websites and users fo the Service. By gathering and remembering information about website preferences through cookies, we can provide a better web and marketing experience. Cookies dont give us access to users computers, and the information we collect through cookies doesnt include personal information.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWhen your agents or end users use the Service we utilize session cookies, which allow us to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to process your online transactions. Session cookies disappear from your computer when the web browser is closed or computer is turned off. We also utilize persistent cookies to identify Zendesk Agents and End Users and make it easier for them to log into and use the Service. Persistent cookies remain on computers after the web browser is closed or the computer is turned off.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe utilize various categories of cookies, which are summarized below along with the options available to you to manage them.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eEssential: Essential cookies are those that are critical to the functionality of the Service. We use these cookies to keep an agent or end user logged into the Service and remember relevant information when the agent or end user returns to the Service.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eFunctional: We use functional cookies to track agents and end users activities in the Service, understand their preferences and improve their user experience. These cookies can also be used to remember configurations of the Service that our customers can customize.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eMarketing: We engage third party providers to serve a variety of marketing cookies that enable us to track and analyze usage, navigational and other statistical information from visitors to the Zendesk Websites. This information does not include personal information though we may reassociate this information with personal information we have collected when it is received. Marketing cookies are also used to track the performance of our advertisements and are employed by third party advertising networks that we utilize. These advertising networks follow online activities of visitors to the Zendesk Websites and use this information to inform, optimize and serve tailored advertisements on the Zendesk Websites or on other websites they visit that we believe would most effectively promote the Service to you. We also use third parties to collect information that assists us in other methods of remarketing our Service to visitors to the Zendesk Websites, including customized email communications.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eYou can generally accept or decline the use of cookies through a functionality built into your web browser.

To learn more about this feature from Google, click \\u003ca href=\\\" Please note that if you do elect to disable your web browsers ability to accept cookies, you may not be able to access or take advantage of many features of the Service.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eMany jurisdictions require or recommend that website operators inform users as to the nature of cookies they utilize and, in certain circumstances, obtain the consent of their users to the placement of certain cookies. If you are a customer of Zendesk, it is your responsibility to inform the individuals with whom you interact using the Service, including your agents and end users as to the types of cookies utilized in the Service and, as necessary, to obtain their consent. If you require more specific information as to the nature of the cookies utilized in the Service for purposes of fulfilling these obligations, please contact us by email at privacy@zendesk.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch4\\u003eWeb Beacons\\u003c/h4\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe also employ web beacons to help us better manage content in the Service by informing us what content is effective. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of internet users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a users computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on websites. We tie the information gathered by web beacons to personal information we otherwise collect, and use them in our HTML-based emails to learn which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns as well as to operate and improve the Service. You can opt-out of these emails by following the unsubscribe instructions within such marketing emails.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch4\\u003eDo Not Track Signals\\u003c/h4\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe do not currently respond to web browsers Do Not Track signals that provide a method to opt out of the collection information about visitors activities on the Zendesk Website and Service, and across other websites. If we do so in the future, we will provide all relevant information in this Policy. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOther Information Sharing\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn addition to the purposes described above, we disclose personal information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe may share information, including personal information with any member of the Zendesk Group, which includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or under common control with Zendesk, Inc.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eLinks to Other Websites\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe Service contains links to websites and applications other than the Service, including websites and applications operated by affiliates and other third parties (Third Party). Please be aware that we do not determine and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of websites and applications operated by Third Parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service, and read the privacy statements of Third Party websites and applications linked to the Service. Zendesk does not endorse and is not responsible for the practices of these Third Parties or their websites or applications. This Policy applies only to information collected by the Service.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003ePublic Forums\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe Service (including the Zendesk Websites) offers publicly-accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information provided in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at privacy@zendesk. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eCustomer Testimonials/Comments/Reviews\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eFrom time to time, we post customer testimonials on the Zendesk Websites which may contain personal information. We obtain the customers consent to post their names along with their testimonials.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eProtection of Information\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eZendesk is committed to ensuring the security of your personal information. We utilize robust precautions to protect the confidentiality and security of the personal information within the Service, by employing technological, physical and administrative security safeguards, such as firewalls and carefully-developed security procedures. For example, when you enter confidential information (such as login credentials or information submitted from within the Service) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). These technologies, procedures and other measures are used in an effort to ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you authorized to access your data. However, no internet, e-mail or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take care in deciding what information you send to us in this way.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSafe Harbor Data Privacy Notice\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eZendesk complies with the US  EU and US  Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks for protecting the privacy of data flowing from the EU and Switzerland to the United States, as set forth by the US Department of Commerce.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe frequently enter agreements with our EU customers to provide them access to our Service, which includes the processing of information relating their customers. In providing our Service, we do not own, control or direct the use of the information stored or processed on our platform at the direction of our customers, and in fact we are largely unaware of what information is being stored on our platform and only access such information as reasonably necessary to provide the Service (including to respond to support requests), as otherwise authorized by our customers or as required by law. We are the data processors and not the data controllers of the information on our platform for purposes of the EU Directive on Data Protection (Directive 95/46/EC) and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection. Our EU or Swiss based customers, who control their customer data and send it to Zendesk for processing, are the controllers of that data and are responsible for compliance with the Directive. In particular, Zendesks customers are responsible for complying with the Directive and relevant data protection legislation in the relevant EU member state before sending personal information to Zendesk for processing. We work with our customers to help them provide notice to their customers concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAs the processors of personal information on behalf of our customers, we follow their instructions with respect to the information they control to the extent consistent with the functionality of our Service. In doing so, we implement technical, physical and administrative measures against unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of, or damage to, personal information as more fully described above under Protection of Information.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eHosting and Data Transfer\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe are based in the United States, but, unless we expressly agree otherwise (including through our Terms), we may host and process data, including personal information, in the United States and in other countries through the Zendesk Group and third parties that we use to operate and manage the Service. When you access or use the Service, or otherwise provide information to us, you are consenting, on behalf of you and your authorized Agents or End-Users, (and representing that you have the authority to provide such consent) to the processing and transfer of information in and to the United States and other countries which may have different privacy laws from your or their country of residence. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eChoice\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe process and store information on behalf of our customers. If you are an individual interacting with a customer of the Service and would no longer like to be contacted by that customer, please contact that customer directly. If you are a Zendesk customer and would like to opt-out of getting marketing communications from Zendesk please contact us at privacy@zendesk or follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each marketing email. Requests to opt-out of transfers to our third-party vendors may also be submitted, but limitations on data sharing may make it difficult or impossible to provide the Service in this manner.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eCorrecting and Updating Your Information\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eCustomers may update or change the personal information they have provided Zendesk by logging into the Service and providing such additional information where applicable. If you are our customer and would like to gain access to, or request deletion of information we have collected as data controllers, please contact us at privacy@zendesk. We will respond to such queries within 30 business days.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eZendesk has no direct relationship with the individuals with whom our customers may interact using the Service. Any such individual seeking access to, or who would like to correct, amend, or delete data which may be stored in the Service should direct his query to the applicable Zendesk customer acting as the data controller for such information.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eData Retention\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eZendesk will retain personal information we process on behalf of our customers or collect directly from our customers for as long as needed to provide Service to our customers, subject to our compliance with this Policy. We may further retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, maintain accurate accounting, financial and other operational records, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We have established internal policies for the deletion of data from customer accounts following termination of a customers subscription to the Service. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eChildrens Personal Information\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eZendesk does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personal information through our Service. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their childrens Internet usage and to help enforce our Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information on our Service without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to Zendesk through our Service, please contact us, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete that information from our databases.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eChanges to the Privacy Policy\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIf we make any material changes to this Policy, we will notify you by email or by posting a prominent notice on the Zendesk Websites prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your agreement to be bound by such changes to this Policy.

To review our updated terms click here. THESE TERMS OF SERVICE (“TERMS”) GOVERN YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICE. IF YOU REGISTER FOR A FREE TRIAL OF OUR SERVICE, THESE TERMS WILL ALSO GOVERN THAT FREE TRIAL. 1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS 1.1 Zendesk, Inc. (“Zendesk,” “We” or “Our”) provides its Service (as defined below) to You through its web site located at (the “Site”), subject to these Terms. 1.2 By accepting these Terms, or by accessing or using the Service or Site, You represent and acknowledge that You have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms, and that the information You provide in registering to the Service is accurate, complete, and is Yours or within Your right to use. If You are entering into these Terms on behalf of a company or another legal entity, You represent that You have the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to these Terms, in which case the terms “You,” “Your” or related capitalized terms herein shall refer to such entity and its affiliates. If You do not have such authority, or if You do not agree with these Terms, You must not accept these Terms and may not use the Service. 1.3 You acknowledge that these Terms constitute a contract between You and Zendesk, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by You and Zendesk, and that these Terms govern Your use of the Service and supersede any other agreements between You and Zendesk. 2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE The “Service” includes (a) the Site, (b) the on-demand Zendesk® help desk system, tools and Zendesk API, and (c) the other services provided to You through the Site based on the plan purchased, including all software, data, text, images, sounds, videos, and other content made available through the Site, or developed via the Zendesk API (collectively, “Content”). Any new features added to or augmenting the Service are also subject to these Terms. The Service may also include basic or expanded support based on the Service plan purchased. Zendesk does its very best to make the Service available as detailed in the applicable Service plan, except for: (a) planned downtime (of which You will be notified in advance), or (b) any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond Our reasonable control, such as, but not limited to, acts of God, acts of government, acts of terror or civil unrest, or technical failures beyond Our control. 3. GENERAL CONDITIONS/ACCESS AND USE OF THE SERVICE 3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, You agree to access and use the Service only for Your internal business purposes as contemplated by these Terms. We believe the objective of running a help desk is to move tickets to a “Closed” state as fast (and kindly) as possible, therefore, You agree to use all reasonable efforts to bring all Your tickets to a closed state. Subject only to Your limited right to access and use the Service as expressly granted to You here, all rights, title and interest in and to the Service and its components, including all related intellectual property rights, will remain with and belong exclusively to Zendesk and its third-party vendors. 3.2 You agree not to (a) license, sublicense, sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, time share or otherwise commercially exploit or make the Service available to any third party, other than as expressly permitted by these Terms; (b) use the Service to process data on behalf of any third party, (c) modify, adapt or hack the Service to falsely imply any sponsorship or association with Zendesk, or otherwise attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or its related systems or networks; (d) use the Service in any unlawful manner, including but not limited to violation of any persons privacy rights, infringing any person’s intellectual property rights, or sending spam or otherwise duplicative or unsolicited messages in violation of applicable law, (e) use the Service in any manner that interferes with or disrupts the integrity or performance of the Service and its components; (f) attempt to decipher, decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise discover the source code of any software making up the Service; (g) use the Service to knowingly post, upload, link to, send or store any content that is unlawful, racist, hateful, obscene, discriminatory, or contains any viruses, malware, Trojan horses, time bombs, or any other similar harmful software; or (h) try to use, or use the Service in violation of these Terms. 3.3 You are responsible for all information, data, text, messages or other materials that You post or is otherwise transmitted via the Service. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your login and account, and are fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under Your login or account. You agree and acknowledge that Your login may only be used by one (1) person, and that You will not share a single login among multiple people. You may create separate logins for as many people as Your plan allows, and otherwise utilize Our unique Multi-Branding and Light Agent features if your plan includes these features. 3.4 Zendesk’s failure to enforce at any time any provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision or of any other provision of these Terms. 4. DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY 4.1 In providing You the Service We shall maintain appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of Your data and the personal data of Your end-users. These safeguards include encryption of Your data in transmission (using SSL or similar technologies), except for certain external third party integrations that do not support encryption, which You may link to the Service at Your choice. 4.2 You agree that Zendesk can access Your accounts information in order to respond to Your service requests. We will not disclose such data except if compelled by law, permitted by You, or pursuant to the terms of the Zendesk Privacy Policy, which is available at and is incorporated into these Terms. 5. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS Each of us shall maintain all rights, title and interest in and to all our respective patents, inventions, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, know-how and any other intellectual property and/or proprietary rights (collectively, “Intellectual Property Rights”). The rights granted to You to use the Service under these Terms do not convey any additional rights in the Service, or in any Intellectual Property Rights associated therewith. Zendesk shall have a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to incorporate into the Service or otherwise use any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or other feedback We receive from You. Zendesk®, and Zendesk’s other product and service names, and logos used or displayed on the Service are registered or unregistered trademarks of Zendesk (collectively, “Marks”), and You may only use such Marks to identify yourself as a customer and user of the Service; provided You do not attempt, now or in the future, to claim any rights in the Marks, degrade the distinctiveness of the Marks, or use the Marks to disparage or misrepresent Zendesk, its services or products. 6. THIRD PARTY SERVICES 6.1 External Sites. The Service may contain links to, or otherwise may allow You to connect to and use certain third party products, services or software under separate terms and conditions (collectively, “Other Services”) in conjunction with Our Service. If You decide to access and use such Other Services, be advised that Your use is governed solely by the terms and conditions of such Other Services, and We do not endorse, are not responsible for, and make no representations as to such Other Services, their content or the manner in which they handle Your data. Zendesk is not liable for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with Your access or use of any such Other Services, or Your reliance on the privacy practices or other policies of such Other Services. 6.2 Integration. The Service may contain features that enable various Other Services (such as social media services like Facebook and Twitter) to be directly integrated into your Zendesk experience. To take advantage of these features, You will be required to register for or log into such Other Services on their respective websites. By enabling third party services within the Service, You are allowing Zendesk to pass Your log-in information to these Other Services for this purpose. 7. BILLING, PLAN MODIFICATIONS AND PAYMENTS 7.1 Billing and Payments. The Service is made available on a pay-as-you-go basis and is charged at the start of Your elected subscription term (generally monthly or annually). If You do not provide Your credit card or other payment information to Zendesk before the expiration of any free trial period, Your account will be suspended until payment information and charge authorization are provided. You will be promptly billed and, if applicable, any trial period will terminate. Thereafter, Your subscription will renew automatically based on Your plan’s renewal cycle. The Service provides an interface for the account owner to change credit card information (e.g., upon card renewal). The account owner will receive a receipt upon each payment received, or they may obtain a receipt from within the application to be able to track the status of Your subscription. 7.2 Modifying Your Subscription. If You choose to upgrade Your plan or number of agents during Your elected subscription period, any incremental cost will be prorated over the remaining term of the subscription period and charged to Your account. Subsequently, You will be charged the adjusted rate on Your next billing cycle. If You are on a monthly billing cycle, You will not see a prorated charge or credit in the current month, but Your new billing rate will be reflected on Your next monthly bill. Regardless of Your billing cycle, there are no refunds or credits for partial months of Service, plan downgrades, or refunds for unused time if You close Your account before the end of Your subscription period. No exceptions will be made in order to treat everyone equally and keep Our administrative costs low for the ultimate benefit of Our customer base. Downgrading Your plan level may cause the loss of content, features, or capacity of Your account and Zendesk does not accept any liability for such loss. Zendesk reserves the right to contact You about special pricing if You maintain an exceptionally high number of end-users, an unusually high monthly ticket ratio per agent, an unusually high level of open tickets or other excessive stress on the Service. 7.3 Overdue charges. If You fail to pay your subscription fee on time, or if Your credit card payment information is entered in error or does not go through for processing and You do not update payment information upon Our request, your entire subscription may be suspended or cancelled. 7.4 Billing Privacy. Zendesk uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use Your billing information except to process Your credit card information for Zendesk. For more information about Our billing practices and Your personal information please visit Our Privacy Policy. 7.5 Taxes. Unless otherwise stated, Our charges do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes assessable by any local, state, provincial or foreign jurisdiction (collectively “Taxes”). You are responsible for paying Taxes except those assessable against Zendesk based on its income. We will invoice You for such Taxes if we believe we have a legal obligation to do so. 8. VOICE FUNCTIONALITY If Your plan allows You to use Our Zendesk Voice service, You understand and agree that (a) the Service is not intended to support or carry emergency calls to any emergency services such as public safety answering points, (b) Zendesk will not be held liable for any claim, damages or loss (and You hereby waive any and all such claims or causes of action), arising from or relating to Your (or Your customers’) inability to use Your Service subscription to make such emergency calls, (c) You are solely responsible for Your operation of Zendesk Voice in compliance with all applicable laws in Your jurisdiction, including but not limited to telephone recording and wiretapping laws, and (d) You will defend, hold harmless and indemnify Zendesk from and against any third party claim arising from any of the foregoing. Zendesk may disable the phone numbers provided to You if unused or substantially underused for 60 days, or if Your Service is otherwise suspended, terminates or cancelled under these Terms. 9 CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION 9.1 The account owner (as defined in the sign-up procedure) is responsible for canceling Your account, and can cancel the account by either clicking on the account link in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen (for immediate cancellation if You paid by credit card) or by contacting Zendesk at support@zendesk. There are no other means of canceling Your account. Once You cancel Your account You will lose access to all of Your content, and We preserve the right to delete all such content in the normal course of operation. This content cannot be recovered once Your account is cancelled. If You cancel the Service before the end of Your current paid-up subscription period, Your cancellation will take effect immediately and You will not be charged again. 9.2 Zendesk reserves the right to (i) modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) and (ii) refuse any/all current and future use of the Service, suspend or terminate your account or any part thereof (or Your use of the Service), and remove and discard any of Your content within the Service if We believe that You have violated these Terms. Zendesk will use all reasonable efforts to contact You directly via email to warn You prior to suspension or termination of Your account. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity may be grounds for immediate termination of Your use of Service, and may be referred to law enforcement authorities. Zendesk shall not be liable to You or any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuation of the Service. 10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES THE SERVICE, INCLUDING THE SITE AND CONTENT, AND ALL SERVER AND NETWORK COMPONENTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AND ZENDESK EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ZENDESK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR-FREE OR VIRUS-FREE, AND NO INFORMATION OR ADVICE OBTAINED BY YOU FROM ZENDESK OR THROUGH THE SERVICE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. 11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 11.1 NO CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) WILL EITHER PARTY TO THESE TERMS, OR SUCH PARTY’S AFFILIATES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST SALES OR BUSINESS, LOST DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER LOSS INCURRED BY SUCH PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OR COULD HAVE FORESEEN SUCH DAMAGES. 11.2 LIMITS ON MONETARY DAMAGES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THESE TERMS, ZENDESK’S (INCLUDING ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES) AGGREGATE LIABILITY, FOR DAMAGES (MONETARY OR OTHERWISE) UNDER THESE TERMS CLAIMED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY ARISING FROM OUR SERVICE, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF (I) ACTUAL DAMAGES INCURRED, OR (II) PAYMENTS MADE BY YOU FOR THE SERVICE DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THIS SECTION 11.2 IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND LIMIT THEIR POTENTIAL LIABILITY GIVEN THE FEES CHARGED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IF ZENDESK WERE TO ASSUME ANY FURTHER LIABILITY OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH HEREIN. THE PARTIES HAVE RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ENTER INTO THESE TERMS. 11.3 Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply to You. IN THESE STATES, ZENDESK’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 12. INDEMNIFICATION 12.1 Indemnification by Zendesk. Zendesk will indemnify and hold You harmless, from and against any claim against You by reason of Your use of the Service as permitted hereunder, brought by a third party alleging that the Service infringes a valid patent or copyright, or misappropriates a third party’s trade secret (such claims, collectively, “Claim”). Zendesk shall, at its expense, defend such Claim and pay damages finally awarded against You in connection therewith, including the reasonable fees and expenses of the attorneys engaged by Zendesk for such defense, provided that (i) You promptly notify Zendesk of the threat or notice of such Claim, (ii) Zendesk will have the sole and exclusive control and authority to select defense attorneys, defend and/or settle any such Claim, and (iii) You fully cooperate with Zendesk in connection therewith. If Your use of the Service has become, or in Zendesk’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of any such Claim, Zendesk may at its option and expense (a) procure for You the right to continue using the Service as set forth hereunder; (b) replace or modify the Service to make it non-infringing; or (c) if options (a) or (b) are not reasonably practicable, terminate these Terms and repay You any unused Service fees. Zendesk will have no liability or obligation under this Section 12.1 with respect to any Claim if such claim is caused in whole or in part by (i) compliance with designs, data, instructions or specifications provided by You; (ii) modification of the Service by anyone other than Zendesk; or (iii) the combination, operation or use of the Service with other hardware or software where the Service would not by itself be infringing. The provisions of this Section 12.1 state the sole, exclusive and entire liability of Zendesk to You and constitute Your sole remedy with respect to a Claim brought by reason of Your permitted use of the Service. 12.2 Indemnification by You. You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Zendesk from and against any claims, actions or demands, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and professional services fees, arising or resulting from Your breach of these Terms, or Your and Your end users’ access to, use, misuse or illegal use of the Service. Zendesk will provide You notice of any such claim, suit, or proceeding. Zendesk reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter which is subject to indemnification under this section, in which case You agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests to assist Zendesk’s defense of such matter. 13. ASSIGNMENT; ENTIRE AGREEMENT; REVISIONS Either party may assign or transfer these Terms, in whole or in part, without restriction, provided the assignee agree to be fully bound by these Terms. These Terms supersede prior versions of these Terms, or any other discussions, agreements or understandings by or among the parties (other than written agreements expressly accepted and executed by both parties). We may amend these Terms from time to time, in which case the new Terms will supersede prior versions. We will notify You of such changes and direct You to the latest version. 14. SEVERABILITY If any provision in these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as to best accomplish the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in effect. 15.

RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES The parties are independent contractors. These Terms do not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship among the parties. 17.

If You do not provide Your credit card or other payment information to Zendesk before the expiration of any free trial period, Your account will be suspended until payment information and charge authorization are provided. You will be promptly billed and, if applicable, any trial period will terminate. Thereafter, Your subscription will renew automatically based on Your plan\\u0026#8217;s renewal cycle. The Service provides an interface for the account owner to change credit card information (e.g., upon card renewal). The account owner will receive a receipt upon each payment received, or they may obtain a receipt from within the application to be able to track the status of Your subscription.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e7.2 Modifying Your Subscription.\\u003c/strong\\u003e If You choose to upgrade Your plan or number of agents during Your elected subscription period, any incremental cost will be prorated over the remaining term of the subscription period and charged to Your account. Subsequently, You will be charged the adjusted rate on Your next billing cycle. If You are on a monthly billing cycle, You will not see a prorated charge or credit in the current month, but Your new billing rate will be reflected on Your next monthly bill. Regardless of Your billing cycle, there are no refunds or credits for partial months of Service, plan downgrades, or refunds for unused time if You close Your account before the end of Your subscription period. No exceptions will be made in order to treat everyone equally and keep Our administrative costs low for the ultimate benefit of Our customer base. Downgrading Your plan level may cause the loss of content, features, or capacity of Your account and Zendesk does not accept any liability for such loss. Zendesk reserves the right to contact You about special pricing if You maintain an exceptionally high number of end-users, an unusually high monthly ticket ratio per agent, an unusually high level of open tickets or other excessive stress on the Service.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e7.3 Overdue charges.\\u003c/strong\\u003e If You fail to pay your subscription fee on time, or if Your credit card payment information is entered in error or does not go through for processing and You do not update payment information upon Our request, your entire subscription may be suspended or cancelled.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e7.4 Billing Privacy.\\u003c/strong\\u003e Zendesk uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use Your billing information except to process Your credit card information for Zendesk.

This Privacy Policy (Policy) explains how we collect and use visitors and customers information, particularly personal information, as part of the Service. The information Zendesk collects and uses is limited to the purpose for which customers engage Zendesk and other purposes expressly described in this Policy. Any discussion of your use of the Service in this Policy is meant to include your visits and other interactions with the Zendesk Websites, whether or not you are a user of Zendesks on-demand customer service support platform. Privacy Certifications To mark its commitment to privacy, Zendesk has entered into a number of voluntary data privacy programs, including the TRUSTe® Privacy Certification Programs, and the United States  European Union and the US-Swiss Safe Harbor programs. We have been awarded TRUSTes Privacy Seal signifying that this Policy and our privacy practices have been reviewed and verified by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTes Program Requirements and Cloud Privacy Requirements, including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information.

In this Policy, personal information means information or an information set that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of Zendesk to identify an individual. Except as described in this Policy, Zendesk will not give, sell, rent or loan any personal information to any third party. Personal information does not include Usage Data which we define as encoded or anonymized information or aggregated data we collect about a group or category of services, features or users which does not contain personally identifying information. Usage Data helps us understand trends in usage of the Service so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor the Service. In addition to collecting and using Usage Data ourselves, we may share Usage Data with third parties, including our customers, partners and service providers, for various purposes, including to help us better understand our customers needs and improve the Service as well as for advertising and marketing purposes. We do not share Usage Data with third parties in a way that would enable them to identify you personally. How Do We Collect, Use and Share Your Personal Information and Other Information? Information You Provide to Us When you register for the Service, we ask for personal information such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address and credit card information, as well as certain related information like your company name and website name. If you sign-up for a 30-day free trial account, you are not required to enter your credit card information unless and until you decide to continue with a paid subscription to the Service. Zendesk uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information for any purpose except for credit card processing on Zendesks behalf. Zendesk may use the personal information you provide to operate the Service and tailor it to your needs, for billing, identification and authentication, to contact and communicate with you about the Service and your use of the Service, send you marketing materials (subject to your opt-out option), for research purposes, and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Service. Zendesk may also share your personal information with its third-party service providers (such as its credit card processors and hosting partners) to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other services we use to operate the Service and maintain a high quality user experience. We do not permit our service providers to use the personal information you provide for their marketing purposes. Log Files As is true with most websites, Zendesk gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes internet protocol addresses as well as browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. Occasionally, we may connect personal information to information gathered in our log files, as necessary to improve the Service for individual customers. Otherwise, we generally use this information as we would any Usage Data, to analyze trends, administer and maintain the Service, or track usage of various features within the Service. Cookies A cookie is a small software file stored temporarily or placed on your computers hard drive. The main purpose of a cookie is to allow a web server to identify your computer and web browser, and tailor web pages and/or login information to your preferences. Cookies help us promptly display the information you need to use the capabilities of the Service and other information which we consider to be of interest to you. By gathering and remembering information about your website preferences through cookies, we can provide a better web and marketing experience. Cookies dont give us access to users computers, and the information we collect through cookies doesnt include personal information. When you use the Service we utilize session cookies, which allow us to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to process your online transactions. Session cookies disappear from your computer when you close your web browser or turn off your computer. We also utilize persistent cookies to identify you as a Zendesk customer, agent or end user and make it easier for you to log into and use the Service. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your web browser or turn off your computer. We utilize various categories of cookies, which are summarized below along with the options available to you to manage them. Essential: Essential cookies are those that are critical to the functionality of the Service. We use these cookies to keep a user logged into the Service and remember relevant information when the user returns to the Service. Functional: We use functional cookies to track users activities in the Service, understand their preferences and improve their user experience. These cookies can also be used to remember configurations of the Service that you can customize. Marketing: We engage third party providers to serve a variety of marketing cookies that enable us track and analyze usage, navigational and other statistical information from visitors to the Zendesk Websites. This information does not include personal information though we may reassociate this information with personal information we have collected when it is received. Marketing cookies are also used to track the performance of our advertisements and are employed by third party advertising networks that we utilize. These ad networks follow online activities of visitors to the Zendesk Websites and use this information to inform, optimize and serve tailored advertisements on the Zendesk Websites or on other websites you visit that we believe would most effectively promote the Service to you. We also use third parties to collect information that assists us in other methods of remarketing our Service to visitors to the Zendesk Websites, including customized email communications. You can generally accept or decline the use of cookies through a functionality built into your web browser.

Please note that if you do elect to disable your web browsers ability to accept cookies, you may not be able to access or take advantage of many features of the Service. Many jurisdictions require or recommend that website operators inform users as to the nature of cookies they utilize and, in certain circumstances, obtain the consent of their users to the placement of certain cookies. If you are a customer of Zendesk, it is your responsibility to inform the individuals with whom you interact using the Service as to the types of cookies utilized in the Service and, as necessary, to obtain their consent. If you require more specific information as to the nature of the cookies utilized in the Service for purposes of fulfilling these obligations, please contact us by email at privacy@zendesk. Web Beacons We also employ web beacons to help us better manage content in the Service by informing us what content is effective. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of internet users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a users computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on websites. We tie the information gathered by web beacons to personal information we otherwise collect, and use them in our HTML-based emails to learn which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns as well as to operate and improve the Service. You can opt-out of these emails by following the unsubscribe instructions within such marketing emails. Other Information Sharing In addition to the purposes described above, we disclose personal information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. Links to Other Websites The Service contains links to other websites and web applications that are not owned or controlled by Zendesk. Please be aware that we do not determine and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service, and read the privacy statements of other websites and web applications linked to the Service. This Policy applies only to information collected by the Service. Public Forums The Service (including the Zendesk Websites) offers publicly-accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at privacy@zendesk. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. Customer Testimonials/Comments/Reviews From time to time, we post customer testimonials on the Zendesk Websites which may contain personal information. We obtain the customers consent to post their names along with their testimonials. Protection of Information Zendesk is committed to ensuring the security of your personal information. We utilize robust precautions to protect the confidentiality and security of the personal information within the Service, by employing technological, physical and administrative security safeguards, such as firewalls and carefully-developed security procedures. For example, when you enter sensitive information (such as login credentials and all your activity on our Service platform) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). These technologies, procedures and other measures are used in an effort to ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you authorized to access your data. However, no internet, e-mail or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take care in deciding what information you send to us in this way. Safe Harbor Data Privacy Notice Zendesk complies with the US  EU and US  Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks for protecting the privacy of data flowing from the EU and Switzerland to the United States, as set forth by the US Department of Commerce. We frequently enter agreements with our EU customers to provide them access to our Service, which includes the processing of information relating their customers. In providing our Service, we do not own, control or direct the use of the information stored or processed on our platform at the direction of our customers, and in fact we are largely unaware of what information is being stored on our platform and only access such information as authorized by our customers or as required by law. Only you or your customers are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such information. As such, we are only the data processors and not the data controllers of the information on our platform for purposes of the EU Directive on Data Protection (Directive 95/46/EC) and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection. Our EU or Swiss customers, who control their customer data and send it to Zendesk for processing, are the controllers of that data and are responsible for compliance with the Directive. In particular, Zendesks customers are responsible for complying with the Directive and relevant data protection legislation in the relevant EU member state before sending personal information to Zendesk for processing. We work with our customers to help them provide notice to their customers concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected. As the processors of personal information on behalf of our customers, we follow their instructions with respect to the information they control. In doing so, we implement appropriate technical, physical and administrative measures against unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of, or damage to, personal information. Choice We process and store information on behalf of our customers. If you are an individual interacting with a customer of the Service and would no longer like to be contacted by that customer, please contact that customer directly. If you are a Zendesk customer and would like to opt-out of getting communications from Zendesk please contact us at privacy@zendesk or follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each marketing email. Requests to opt-out of transfers to our third-party vendors will also be considered, but limitations on data sharing may make it difficult or impossible to provide the Service in this manner. Correcting and Updating Your Information Customers may update or change the personal information they have provided Zendesk by logging into the Service and providing such additional information where applicable. If you are our customer and would like to gain access to, or request deletion of information we have collected as data controllers, please contact us at privacy@zendesk. We will respond to such queries within 30 business days. Zendesk has no direct relationship with the individuals with whom our customers may interact using the Service. Any such individual seeking access to, or who would like to correct, amend, or delete data which may be stored in the Service should direct his query to the applicable Zendesk customer acting as the data controller for such information. At the request of our customers, we remove any data placed in their accounts within 30 business days. Data Retention Zendesk will retain personal information we process on behalf of our customers for as long as needed to provide Service to our customers, subject to our compliance with this Policy. We may further retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Childrens Personal Information Zendesk does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. Changes to the Privacy Policy If we make any material changes to this Policy, we will notify you by email or by posting a prominent notice on the Zendesk Websites prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your agreement to be bound by such changes to this Policy. Your only remedy, if you do not accept the terms of this Policy, is to discontinue use of the Service.

Any discussion of your use of the Service in this Policy is meant to include your visits and other interactions with the Zendesk Websites, whether or not you are a user of Zendesks on-demand customer service support platform.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003ePrivacy Certifications\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eTo mark its commitment to privacy, Zendesk has entered into a number of voluntary data privacy programs, including the TRUSTe® Privacy Certification Programs, and the United States  European Union and the US-Swiss Safe Harbor programs. We have been awarded TRUSTes Privacy Seal signifying that this Policy and our privacy practices have been reviewed and verified by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTes \\u003ca href=\\\" Requirements\\u003c/a\\u003e and \\u003ca href=\\\" Privacy Requirements\\u003c/a\\u003e, including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. TRUSTes mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy programs. Zendesk also complies with the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from EU member countries and Switzerland. We have certified our adherence to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement. Our compliance has been verfied by TRUSTe, which has awarded Zendesk the TRUSTes Certified Privacy Seal.

Except as described in this Policy, Zendesk will not give, sell, rent or loan any personal information to any third party.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003ePersonal information does not include Usage Data which we define as encoded or anonymized information or aggregated data we collect about a group or category of services, features or users which does not contain personally identifying information. Usage Data helps us understand trends in usage of the Service so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor the Service. In addition to collecting and using Usage Data ourselves, we may share Usage Data with third parties, including our customers, partners and service providers, for various purposes, including to help us better understand our customers needs and improve the Service as well as for advertising and marketing purposes. We do not share Usage Data with third parties in a way that would enable them to identify you personally.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eHow Do We Collect, Use and Share Your Personal Information and Other Information?\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003ch4\\u003eInformation You Provide to Us\\u003c/h4\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWhen you register for the Service, we ask for personal information such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address and credit card information, as well as certain related information like your company name and website name. If you sign-up for a 30-day free trial account, you are not required to enter your credit card information unless and until you decide to continue with a paid subscription to the Service. Zendesk uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information for any purpose except for credit card processing on Zendesks behalf.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eZendesk may use the personal information you provide to operate the Service and tailor it to your needs, for billing, identification and authentication, to contact and communicate with you about the Service and your use of the Service, send you marketing materials (subject to your opt-out option), for research purposes, and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Service.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eZendesk may also share your personal information with its third-party service providers (such as its credit card processors and hosting partners) to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other services we use to operate the Service and maintain a high quality user experience. We do not permit our service providers to use the personal information you provide for their marketing purposes.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch4\\u003eLog Files\\u003c/h4\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAs is true with most websites, Zendesk gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes internet protocol addresses as well as browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. Occasionally, we may connect personal information to information gathered in our log files, as necessary to improve the Service for individual customers. Otherwise, we generally use this information as we would any Usage Data, to analyze trends, administer and maintain the Service, or track usage of various features within the Service.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch4\\u003eCookies \\u003c/h4\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eA cookie is a small software file stored temporarily or placed on your computers hard drive. The main purpose of a cookie is to allow a web server to identify your computer and web browser, and tailor web pages and/or login information to your preferences. Cookies help us promptly display the information you need to use the capabilities of the Service and other information which we consider to be of interest to you. By gathering and remembering information about your website preferences through cookies, we can provide a better web and marketing experience. Cookies dont give us access to users computers, and the information we collect through cookies doesnt include personal information.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWhen you use the Service we utilize session cookies, which allow us to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to process your online transactions. Session cookies disappear from your computer when you close your web browser or turn off your computer. We also utilize persistent cookies to identify you as a Zendesk customer, agent or end user and make it easier for you to log into and use the Service. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your web browser or turn off your computer.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe utilize various categories of cookies, which are summarized below along with the options available to you to manage them.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003eEssential:\\u003c/em\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e \\u003c/strong\\u003eEssential cookies are those that are critical to the functionality of the Service.

This information does not include personal information though we may reassociate this information with personal information we have collected when it is received. Marketing cookies are also used to track the performance of our advertisements and are employed by third party advertising networks that we utilize. These ad networks follow online activities of visitors to the Zendesk Websites and use this information to inform, optimize and serve tailored advertisements on the Zendesk Websites or on other websites you visit that we believe would most effectively promote the Service to you. We also use third parties to collect information that assists us in other methods of remarketing our Service to visitors to the Zendesk Websites, including customized email communications.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eYou can generally accept or decline the use of cookies through a functionality built into your web browser.

To learn more about this feature from Google, click \\u003ca href=\\\" Please note that if you do elect to disable your web browsers ability to accept cookies, you may not be able to access or take advantage of many features of the Service.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eMany jurisdictions require or recommend that website operators inform users as to the nature of cookies they utilize and, in certain circumstances, obtain the consent of their users to the placement of certain cookies. If you are a customer of Zendesk, it is your responsibility to inform the individuals with whom you interact using the Service as to the types of cookies utilized in the Service and, as necessary, to obtain their consent. If you require more specific information as to the nature of the cookies utilized in the Service for purposes of fulfilling these obligations, please contact us by email at \\u003ca href=\\\"mailto:privacy@zendesk\\\"\\u003eprivacy@zendesk\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch4\\u003eWeb Beacons\\u003c/h4\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe also employ web beacons to help us better manage content in the Service by informing us what content is effective. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of internet users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a users computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on websites. We tie the information gathered by web beacons to personal information we otherwise collect, and use them in our HTML-based emails to learn which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns as well as to operate and improve the Service. You can opt-out of these emails by following the unsubscribe instructions within such marketing emails.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eOther Information Sharing\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn addition to the purposes described above, we disclose personal information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. \\u003cstrong\\u003e\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eLinks to Other Websites\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe Service contains links to other websites and web applications that are not owned or controlled by Zendesk. Please be aware that we do not determine and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service, and read the privacy statements of other websites and web applications linked to the Service. This Policy applies only to information collected by the Service.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003ePublic Forums\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe Service (including the Zendesk Websites) offers publicly-accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at \\u003ca href=\\\"mailto:privacy@zendesk\\\"\\u003eprivacy@zendesk\\u003c/a\\u003e. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eCustomer Testimonials/Comments/Reviews\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eFrom time to time, we post customer testimonials on the Zendesk Websites which may contain personal information. We obtain the customers consent to post their names along with their testimonials.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eProtection of Information\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eZendesk is committed to ensuring the security of your personal information. We utilize robust precautions to protect the confidentiality and security of the personal information within the Service, by employing technological, physical and administrative security safeguards, such as firewalls and carefully-developed security procedures. For example, when you enter sensitive information (such as login credentials and all your activity on our Service platform) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). These technologies, procedures and other measures are used in an effort to ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you authorized to access your data. However, no internet, e-mail or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take care in deciding what information you send to us in this way.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eSafe Harbor Data Privacy Notice \\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eZendesk complies with the US  EU and US  Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks for protecting the privacy of data flowing from the EU and Switzerland to the United States, as set forth by the US Department of Commerce.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe frequently enter agreements with our EU customers to provide them access to our Service, which includes the processing of information relating their customers. In providing our Service, we do not own, control or direct the use of the information stored or processed on our platform at the direction of our customers, and in fact we are largely unaware of what information is being stored on our platform and only access such information as authorized by our customers or as required by law. Only you or your customers are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such information. As such, we are only the data processors and not the data controllers of the information on our platform for purposes of the EU Directive on Data Protection (Directive 95/46/EC) and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection. Our EU or Swiss customers, who control their customer data and send it to Zendesk for processing, are the controllers of that data and are responsible for compliance with the Directive. In particular, Zendesks customers are responsible for complying with the Directive and relevant data protection legislation in the relevant EU member state before sending personal information to Zendesk for processing. We work with our customers to help them provide notice to their customers concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAs the processors of personal information on behalf of our customers, we follow their instructions with respect to the information they control. In doing so, we implement appropriate technical, physical and administrative measures against unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of, or damage to, personal information.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eChoice\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe process and store information on behalf of our customers.

Requests to opt-out of transfers to our third-party vendors will also be considered, but limitations on data sharing may make it difficult or impossible to provide the Service in this manner.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eCorrecting and Updating Your Information \\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eCustomers may update or change the personal information they have provided Zendesk by logging into the Service and providing such additional information where applicable.

We will respond to such queries within 30 business days.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eZendesk has no direct relationship with the individuals with whom our customers may interact using the Service. Any such individual seeking access to, or who would like to correct, amend, or delete data which may be stored in the Service should direct his query to the applicable Zendesk customer acting as the data controller for such information. At the request of our customers, we remove any data placed in their accounts within 30 business days.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eData Retention\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eZendesk will retain personal information we process on behalf of our customers for as long as needed to provide Service to our customers, subject to our compliance with this Policy.

We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your agreement to be bound by such changes to this Policy. Your only remedy, if you do not accept the terms of this Policy, is to discontinue use of the Service.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eBusiness Transactions\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eZendesk may assign or transfer this Policy, and your user account and related information and data, including any personal information, to any person or entity that acquires all or substantially all of the business, stock or assets of, or is merged with.

Talent from underrepresented communities have opportunities to develop their careers to match our growth as an organization. “As an Afro-Caribbean woman with a background outside the software industry, I experience everyday the benefits of bringing together diverse teams to solve complex problems.” Nancy Díaz Lemmon Read the story of Nimisha Professional and cultural development We’ve created programs to help employees develop new skills towards their career, as well as support our inclusive culture. Education on racism, equity, and privilege Every employee is assigned training annually that explores racism, equity, allyship and privilege. These equip our employees with practical tools to apply what they’ve learned into their day-to-day actions. Manager essentials series A leadership program designed to equip people managers with the fundamentals of leading themselves, their teams, and our business. The program includes meaningful integration of inclusive leadership, unconscious bias, and psychological safety. Inclusion from day one Starting on day one at Zendesk, during our New Hire Onboarding, each employee is introduced to our culture with an emphasis on DEI and the role that each employee has to play in promoting an inclusive workplace. Empowering individual development Programs such as BetterUp Coaching and Ellevate encourage and enable employees at all levels to dedicate time to intentionally building their own career path. “My coach has taught me how to approach conversations and interactions in a way that creates a really positive win-win environment and to frame challenges as a common goal to work towards together. This shift in how to approach interactions has been life-changing and will forever impact my well-being and success. I am so grateful!” BetterUp Program participant Fostering a diverse workforce Every organization at Zendesk is committed to supporting DEI goals to address organizational and location specific needs. We’ll continue to evolve how we attract, retain, and support our talent.

Leadership includes director level or above. Due to rounding, some figures don’t total 100%. Zendesk classifies “tech” employees by job role. Technical roles are those that rely heavily on knowledge and skills in areas such as engineering and mathematics to support the business. Examples include roles in data science, software engineering, and product management. We recognize that our current data is limited in that gender is presented as a binary. In early 2022, we took our first steps toward a more inclusive voluntary self identification (Self-ID) program by adding sexual orientation and gender identity options beyond cisgender man and woman in the U.S. This was an important first step toward better informing Zendesk of the broader diversity of our workforce. Zendesk’s latest EEO-1 Type 2 Report can be accessed below. This document cuts data a little differently from what is detailed above, which is more representative of how we track our efforts in diversity representation. Also note that the EEO-1 report is a snapshot of one moment in time and based on categories mandated by the federal government. In addition, the EEO-1 report may measure data in a different manner than we disclose in other publications or filingsload the Employer Information Report EEO-1 ReportIreland only: For Zendesk International Limited's 2022 Ireland Gender Pay Gap report click here. Our mission Weave DE&I into the fabric of our culture Our DEI strategy is driven by a people first and leader-led approach. For our employees Create a culture where diversity is valued, and all employees feel included, supported, and can be their true selves. For our customers Foster a diverse workforce and inclusive products that reflect our customers and their needs, leading to better experiences. For our community Use our resources to bring awareness to important causes, combat injustices, and support causes in our broader community. Inclusive culture stories Great customer experience requires more than the right tools. It's also about the people. Our people. Read more on the blog “We’re better and stronger when we operate with a collective mindset of inclusivity with our colleagues, our customers, and the world around us.” Prelini Udayan-Chiechi SVP Global Digital & Regional Marketing An empathy-led strategy for change Between a global health crisis and civil unrest, multiple crises affected our employees in the last year. As a company, we felt an urgent need to find meaningful ways to support them. By listening to the concerns of our employees, we created our Equity Policy, programs that prioritized employee mental health and well-being, and Empathy Circles, a safe space for employees. Empathy circles Empathy Circles are a safe space for employees to share their experiences - and for leadership to listen and learn. These conversations have become an important part of driving our DEI actions. So important, in fact, we created a playbook to share our insights with others. Download the Empathy Circles Playbook Racial equity and justice commitments Silence is complicity - and actions are the loudest words. Zendesk remains committed to playing an active role in establishing a more equitable society, starting with necessary improvements to how we address these challenges. We want to be an active catalyst for change in the SaaS space, broader tech sector, and the global community. See our values in action Employee experience Employee communities Employee Communities (ECs) play a critical role in building our culture. They teach us how we can embed inclusive practices within leadership, create communities that bring us together, and, most importantly, provide our employees with support tailored to their cultural needs. “Our friends and neighbors fighting their own battles need us to show up as an informed ally.” Ryan Gailey Read the stories of Cheyanne, Jamal, and Ryan Global Veterans Network The Global Veterans Network celebrates veterans in and out of Zendesk, helping them transition into the workforce. Mosaic Mosaic encourages people of color at Zendesk to embrace and celebrate their differences, and creates a safe space for discussion, networking, and professional growth. Pride Pride ensures that all LGBTQ+ employees are valued, seen, and supported. The Village The Village provides a support system to employees balancing work and parenting or caregiving. Women at Zendesk Women at Zendesk celebrates women at every level of their careers, uplifting them and helping them achieve their personal and professional goals. Women in Engineering Women in Engineering champion and create a space where women engineers can meet and build supportive relationships with each other across each office. The Bridge The Bridge supports and provides a space for multigenerational employees and their allies. Whole Self Whole Self brings employees together to learn, understand, and share their stories about mental health, neurodiversity (ADHD, OCD, ASD, etc), and physical disabilities. “Building inclusive leadership at scale is critical to shaping Zendesk’s future. Leaders impact the candidate and employee experience every single day through how they behave and showcase our values. Our leaders are essential to empowering our diverse, global, digital-first community on our journey from great to iconic.” Michelle Saurin Senior Director, Talent & Leadership Development at Zendesk Equity at Zendesk Zendesk is committed to creating a more equitable global workplace by fostering a culture of respect, fairness, and inclusion. No matter your background, personal experiences, or unique life situations, we’re committed to your success. Prohibiting destructive behavior Zendesk prohibits destructive behaviors such as discrimination, harassment, microaggressions, and retaliation. Making equal pay a priority We review, no less than annually, our pay practices and parity, and make adjustments where needed. Creating equitable and inclusive workplaces Our goal is to consistently build an equitable and inclusive workplace experience for all our employees globally. Accessibility The customer service industry is a job source for millions of people. But if people can’t use our technology, they can’t access those jobs. And, if customer service software isn’t created with accessibility for all in mind, a large number of people could be cut off from getting resources they desperately need. We strive to create thoughtful technology, so that everyone feels empowered, regardless of how they access technology or experience the world. \"At Zendesk we don't think about Accessibility as a technical or business issue. We consider it a human right. It's about inclusivity and opportunity for everyone. By shipping accessible products, we can drive disability inclusion at scale.\" Jon Aniano SVP, Product Our community Creating a more equitable world Zendesk’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion includes not only our offices across the globe, but the world outside our windows. We’re committed to working with organizations making a difference in our communities, while developing relationships with diverse businesses. Read our global impact report Read the story of Aza Supplier diversity Supplier diversity programs fuel growth for companies which often don’t get the support, visibility, or resources they need to sustain their business. At Zendesk, we are committed to engaging with small and diverse businesses as part of our strategic supply base. We believe this commitment will create an advantage for our customers, help diverse businesses thrive, and stay true to one of Zendesk’s core values - improving the communities where we live and work.” Partnering towards a better world Zendesk strongly believes in being a catalyst for change in the SaaS space, broader tech sector, and the global community. But we can’t create a more equitable world alone. We’ve partnered with organizations that are doing truly innovative and inspiring work in the diversity, equity, and inclusion space.

View our open roles Skip “In the military you can’t fire anyone. Plus you don’t get to pick the people on your team.” Skip is a US Navy veteran who was sent to California in the ‘80s and never left. His experience in the military taught him responsibility, meritocracy, and how to build a team with people from different backgrounds. To build trust, he learned how to find common ground with all kinds of people — no matter where they came from. Brandon “There’s only one me and the only person who can do that excellently is myself!” Brandon is used to being the only black man in the room. He’s come up in his career knowing that he has a bit of a spotlight on him because he stands out. Though he takes it in stride, Brandon has had his fair share of teachable moments with colleagues and friends. He lives with integrity, looking for opportunities to change conditions that create systems of oppression, stereotyping, and more. Nimisha “I can't imagine what I would be if I stopped being an engineer or an artist. It's so core to my identity and I love it.” Nimisha is a software engineer and professional fine artist who came to the United States from India in 2007. Though Nimisha has experienced bias in her life, she’s also found the right allies and mentors to help her grow. At Zendesk, she co-leads the Women in Engineering group to help the company in its efforts to do better. Through her art, she explores social inequality, inspired by her surroundings and finding her identity as a woman of color and a global citizen. Cheyanne “Always advocate for yourself. Even if it doesn't yield the result you wanted, at least you can hold your head high knowing you believed in yourself.” Cheyanne doesn’t shy away from being confident. Working with Type 1 diabetes, she’s learned to take care of herself and communicate her needs to her team. And as a member of the Women at Zendesk group, she knows not to back down if her confidence is perceived as ‘aggressive.’ She practices care and compassion — values she thinks everyone should hold, regardless of gender. Jamal “As you gain knowledge and experience over time, your identity is built over time too. You learn to be more adaptable.” Born in Punjab, Pakistan, Jamal moved to Germany as a teenager. After adjusting to culture shock—he claims he caused his parents trouble—he spent eight years in the German armed forces. Now, he’s a Zendesk account executive and an active member of his local Ahmadiyya Muslim community. He believes in focusing on his goals, counting his blessings, and embracing setbacks as a natural path to growth. Ryan “Our friends and neighbors fighting their own battles need us to show up as an informed ally.” Ryan is a US Army Veteran who sees the military as a microcosm of the struggles of society as a whole. Whether it’s grappling with racial inequity, gender discrimination, or intolerance of any kind, he sees Veterans as uniquely ready to show up as allies. It’s a matter of resilience, the ability to work with people from all kinds of backgrounds, and of course, showing up for the fight, ready to get comfortable being uncomfortable. Aza “I am proud that my friends and family accept me for who I am, regardless of my sexuality.” Out of drag, you can call him Aza. In drag, please refer to her as Della (it takes a lot of effort to look this good). Based in Melbourne, Della graces team meetings, parties, and even global Zendesk events. Though it’s not always easy being a public drag performer, Aza finds joy in sharing Della with “like-minded, beautiful people.” He believes that when you find those people, you’ll never be short of love.

It is rare that I'm the first person to run into any given situation. Sometimes that's just commiseration on feedback posts, but more often, it's a solution that I didn't think to consider. I find the user-created guides help me tremendously. The mods are supportive of each others' work and are often the first to share their experiences on the forums, which makes them an invaluable resource when I need help.”Chris BulinSupport Services Enablement Manager at IthakaLearn more about ChrisAdditional resourcesMore goodies for your enjoymentUpdatesDon't miss out on our product announcements and weekly community digest newsletter to our updatesStartupsGet started on the right foot and join our startups community.

Zendesk offers multiple data locality choices including the United States (US), Australia (AU), Japan (JP), or European Economic Area (EEA). For more information on product, plan, and regional offerings please see our Regional Data Hosting Policy. Vendor Security Zendesk minimizes risks associated with third-party vendors by performing security reviews on all vendors with any level of access to our systems or Service Data. Network Security Dedicated Security Team Our globally distributed Security Team is on call 24/7 to respond to security alerts and events. Protection Our network is protected through the use of key AWS security services, integration with our Cloudflare edge protection networks, regular audits, and network intelligence technologies, which monitor and/or block known malicious traffic and network attacks. Architecture Our network security architecture consists of multiple security zones. More sensitive systems like database servers are protected in our most trusted zones. Other systems are housed in zones commensurate with their sensitivity, depending on function, information classification, and risk. Depending on the zone, additional security monitoring and access controls will apply. DMZs are utilized between the Internet, and internally between the different zones of trust. Network Vulnerability Scanning Network security scanning gives us deep insight for quick identification of out-of-compliance or potentially vulnerable systems. Third-Party Penetration Tests In addition to our extensive internal scanning and testing program, each year Zendesk employs third-party security experts to perform a broad penetration test across the Zendesk Production and Corporate Networks. Security Incident Event Management Our Security Incident Event Management (SIEM) system gathers extensive logs from important network devices and host systems. The SIEM alerts on triggers that notify the Security team based on correlated events for investigation and response. Intrusion Detection and Prevention Service ingress and egress points are instrumented and monitored to detect anomalous behavior. These systems are configured to generate alerts when incidents and values exceed predetermined thresholds and use regularly updated signatures based on new threats. This includes 24/7 system monitoring. Threat Intelligence Program Zendesk participates in several threat intelligence sharing programs. We monitor threats posted to these threat intelligence networks and take action based on risk. DDoS Mitigation Zendesk has architected a multi-layer approach to DDoS mitigation. A core technology partnership with Cloudflare provides network edge defenses, while the use of AWS scaling and protection tools provides deeper protection along with our use of AWS DDoS specific services. Logical Access Access to the Zendesk Production Network is restricted on an explicit need-to-know basis, utilizes least privilege, is frequently audited and monitored, and is controlled by our Operations Team. Employees accessing the Zendesk Production Network are required to use multiple factors of authentication. Security Incident Response In case of a system alert, events are escalated to our 24/7 teams providing Operations, Network Engineering, and Security coverage. Employees are trained on security incident response processes, including communication channels and escalation paths. Encryption Encryption in Transit All communications with Zendesk UI and APIs are encrypted via industry standard HTTPS/TLS (TLS 1.2 or higher) over public networks. This ensures that all traffic between you and Zendesk is secure during transit. Additionally for email, our product leverages opportunistic TLS by default. Transport Layer Security (TLS) encrypts and delivers email securely, mitigating eavesdropping between mail servers where peer services support this protocol. Exceptions for encryption may include any use of in-product SMS functionality, any other third-party app, integration, or service subscribers may choose to leverage at their own discretion. Encryption at Rest Service Data is encrypted at rest in AWS using AES-256 key encryption. Availability & Continuity Uptime Zendesk maintains a publicly available system-status webpage, which includes system availability details, scheduled maintenance, service incident history, and relevant security events. Redundancy Zendesk employs service clustering and network redundancies to eliminate single points of failure. Our strict backup regime and/or our Enhanced Disaster Recovery service offering allows us to deliver a high level of service availability, as Service Data is replicated across availability zones. Disaster Recovery Our Disaster Recovery (DR) program ensures that our services remain available and are easily recoverable in the case of a disaster. This is accomplished through building a robust technical environment, creating Disaster Recovery plans, and testing activities. Enhanced Disaster Recovery Our Enhanced Disaster Recovery package adds contractual objectives for Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO). These are supported through our capability to prioritize operations of Enhanced Disaster Recovery subscribers during any declared disaster event. Get more information on Disaster Recovery Guarantees. Application Security Security Development (SDLC) Secure Code Training Annual secure code training for all engineers, based on OWASP Top 10 security risks. Framework Security Controls Zendesk leverages modern and secure open-source frameworks with security controls to limit exposure to OWASP Top 10 security risks. These inherent controls reduce our exposure to SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF), among others. Quality Assurance Our Quality Assurance (QA) department reviews and tests our code base. Dedicated application security engineers on staff identify, test, and triage security vulnerabilities in code. Separate Environments Testing and staging environments are logically separated from the Production environment. No Service Data is used in our development or test environments. Vulnerability Management Dynamic Vulnerability Scanning We employ third-party security tooling to continuously and dynamically scan our core applications against common web application security risks, including, but not limited to the OWASP Top 10 security risks. We maintain a dedicated in-house product security team to test and work with engineering teams to remediate any discovered issues. Software Composition Analysis We scan the libraries and dependencies used in our products to identify vulnerabilities and ensure the vulnerabilities are managed. Third-Party Penetration Testing In addition to our extensive internal scanning and testing program, Zendesk employs third-party security experts to perform detailed penetration tests on different applications within our family of products. Responsible Disclosure / Bug Bounty Program Our Responsible Disclosure Program gives security researchers as well as subscribers an avenue for safely testing and notifying Zendesk of security vulnerabilities through our partnership with HackerOne. Product Security Authentication Security Authentication Options Zendesk has several different authentication options: subscribers can enable native Zendesk authentication, social media Single sign-on (SSO) (Facebook, Twitter, Google), and/or Enterprise SSO (SAML, JWT) for end-user and/or agent authentication. Learn about user access. Configurable Password Policy Zendesk native authentication for products available through the Admin Center provides the following levels of password security: low, medium, and high, as well as set custom password rules for agents and admins. Zendesk also allows different password security levels to apply to end users vs. agents and admins. Only admins can change the password security level. Learn about configurable password policies. 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) Zendesk native authentication for products available through the Admin Center offers 2-factor (2FA) for agents and admins via SMS or an authenticator app. Learn about 2FA. Service Credential Storage Zendesk follows secure credential storage best practices by never storing passwords in human-readable format, and only as the result of a secure, salted, one-way hash. Additional Product Security Features Role-Based Access Controls Access to data within Zendesk applications is governed by role-based access control (RBAC) and can be configured to define granular access privileges. Zendesk supports various permission levels for users (owner, admin, agent, end-user, etc.). Learn about user roles: Support Default Roles Support Custom Roles *Enterprise only Chat Default Roles Chat Custom Roles *Enterprise only Explore Default Roles Guide Default Roles Talk Default Roles Session Time Details on global security and user access IP Restrictions Any Zendesk account can restrict access to their Zendesk Support to users within a specific range of IP addresses. Only users from the allowed IP addresses will be able to sign in to your Zendesk account. You can allow subscribers (not agents or admins) to bypass this restriction. For more information, see Restricting access to Zendesk Support and your Help Center using IP restrictions and Using IP Access Restriction in Chat. Hosted Encryption Certificates for Help Center (TLS) Zendesk provides free TLS encryption for host-mapped Guide help centers. Zendesk uses Let’s Encrypt to request certificates and automatically renews the certificate before it expires. You can also upload your own certificate, if you choose. To learn more about setting up encryption certificates for a Guide help center please see Setting up a hosted TLS encryption certificate. File Restrictions in Chat Zendesk Chat allows the ability to restrict what file types are sent to agents. Alternatively, you can choose to turn off file sending entirely in the Chat product. To learn about this feature, see Managing file sending in live chat. Audit Logs Zendesk offers Audit Logs to accounts with Enterprise/Enterprise Plus plans. These logs include account changes, user changes, app changes, business rules, ticket deletions, and settings. The Audit Log is available in both the Admin Center and Support API. To learn more about Audit Logs and see what information is available within the log please see Viewing the audit log for changes. Private Attachments Subscribers can configure their instance so that users are required to sign in to view ticket attachments. Learn about Private Attachments. Redaction Zendesk has two types of redaction for removing sensitive data: Manual redaction provides the ability to redact or remove sensitive data in Support ticket comments, and securely delete attachments, so you can protect confidential information. The data is redacted from tickets via the UI or API to prevent sensitive information from being stored in Zendesk. Learn about redaction via the UI or API. Automatic redaction allows for automatic redaction of credit card numbers from subscriber-submitted tickets. When enabled, credit card numbers are partially replaced with blank boxes in the ticket. They are also redacted from logs and database entries. To learn more about how to enable this feature and how credit card numbers are identified, see Automatically redacting credit card numbers from tickets and from chats. Spam Filter for Guide help center Zendesk’s spam filtering service can be used to prevent end-user spam posts from being published in your Guide help center. Learn about filtering spam in Guide. Email Signing (DKIM/DMARC) Zendesk offers DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail) and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, & Conformance) for signing outbound emails from Zendesk when you have to set up an external email domain on your Zendesk. Using an email service that supports these features helps you stop email spoofing. Learn about digitally signing your email. Device Tracking Zendesk tracks the devices used to sign in to each user account. When someone signs into an account from a new device, it is added to the device list in that user's profile. That user can get an email notification when a new device is added, and should follow up if the activity seems suspicious. Suspicious sessions can be terminated through the agent UI. Learn about device tracking. HR Security Security Awareness Policies Zendesk has developed a comprehensive set of security policies covering a range of topics. These policies are shared with and made available to all employees and contractors with access to Zendesk information assets. Training All employees attend a Security Awareness Training, which is given upon hire and annually thereafter. All engineers receive annual Secure Code Training. The Security team provides additional security awareness updates via email, blog posts, and in presentations during internal events. Employee Vetting Background Checks Zendesk performs background checks on all new employees in accordance with local laws. These checks are also required for contractors. The background check includes criminal, education, and employment verification. Cleaning crews are included. Confidentiality Agreements All new hires are required to sign Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality agreements. Welcome to the Zendesk Global Privacy Program Zendesk has a formal global privacy and data protection program, which includes cross-functional key stakeholders including Legal, Security, Product, and Executive sectors of the company. As privacy advocates, we work diligently to ensure our Services and team members are dedicated to compliance with applicable regulatory and industry frameworks. Compliance Australian Privacy Act of 1988 and Privacy Principles The Australian Privacy Act of 1998 (as amended) provides several data subject rights and added mandatory notification of eligible data breaches. Unlike the GDPR, there are no concepts of data controller and data processor. Brazil Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD) The Brazilian General Data Protection Law or Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (“LGPD”), was entered into effect on September 18, 2020. LGPD is a comprehensive data protection law which covers the activities of data controllers and processors and provides individual rights. Zendesk subscribers that collect and store personal data in Zendesk Services may be considered “controllers” under the LGPD. Controllers bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that their processing of personal data is compliant with relevant data protection law, including the LGPD. Zendesk acts as a “processor,” as such term is defined in the LGPD, with respect to the processing of personal data through our Services. Subscribers can view our Product Guides and Service Data Deletion Policy for more detailed information on how to use Zendesk’s products to align with compliance initiatives National Authority for Protection Data (“ANPD”) may issue additional guidance for the LGPD in the future. Zendesk will continue to actively track the law and we will continue to keep our subscribers updated on features and functionality they can use to support their compliance efforts. Zendesk’s LGPD Addendum has been incorporated into Zendesk’s Data Processing Agreement. If you would like to review and/or execute Zendesk’s Data Processing Agreement, please click here. California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") & California Privacy Rights Act (\"CPRA\") The California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798 et seq. (“CCPA”) is a U.S. law enacted in the State of California, which went into force on January 1, 2020. It expands upon the privacy rights available to certain California consumers, and requires certain companies to comply with various data protection requirements. Please also visit the final CCPA Regulations and the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”). A few CPRA provisions went into effect on December 16, 2020, with the remaining provisions of the CPRA becoming operative on January 1, 2023. Zendesk subscribers that collect and store personal information in Zendesk Services may be considered “Businesses” under the CCPA. Businesses bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that their processing of personal data is compliant with relevant data protection law, including the CCPA. Zendesk acts as a “Service Provider,” as such term is defined in the current version of the CCPA, with respect to the processing of personal information through our Services. Therefore, Zendesk collects, accesses, maintains, uses, processes, and transfers the personal information of our subscribers and our subscriber’s end-users processed through the Services solely for the purpose of performing our obligations under our existing contract(s) with our subscribers; and for no commercial purpose other than the performance of such obligations and improvement of the Services we provide. We do not “sell” our subscriber’s personal information as defined under the CCPA. We may share aggregated and/or anonymized information regarding use of the Service(s), which is not considered personal information under the CCPA, with third parties to help us develop and improve the Services and provide our subscribers with more relevant content and service offerings as detailed in our subscriber agreements. Zendesk’s CCPA Addendum has been incorporated into Zendesk’s Data Processing Agreement. If you would like to review and/or execute Zendesk’s Data Processing Agreement, please click here. If you would like to review and/or execute Zendesk’s US State Addendum to the Master Subscription Agreement, please click here. Canada Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act went into effect in 2000 and is focused around ten fair information principles, which form the rules for collection, use, access, and disclosure of personal information. In October of 2021, the International Technology Association of Canada and Information Technology Industry Council suggested changes to PIPEDA to provide greater privacy and transparency rights for Canadian citizens. Data Processing Agreement (DPA) You can review and/or execute Zendesk’s DPA here. The Zendesk DPA covers the specific processing activities and security measures applicable to our Services and incorporates the new EU Standard Contractual Clauses (“EU SCCs”). If you require your existing Zendesk DPA be updated to incorporate the new EU SCCs and the UK Addendum, but do not wish to execute a new DPA, you can review and/or execute Zendesk’s Data Transfer Addendum here. Subscribers can read our Product Guides and Service Data Deletion Policy for detailed information on how to use Zendesk’s products to assist in compliance with data protection and privacy laws. Europe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Since our inception, Zendesk’s approach has been anchored by a strong commitment to privacy, security, compliance, and transparency. This approach includes supporting our subscribers’ compliance with EU data protection requirements, such as those set out in the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). If a subscriber collects, transmits, hosts, or analyzes personal data of EU citizens, GDPR requires the subscriber to use third-party data processors who guarantee their ability to implement the technical and organizational requirements of the GDPR. To further earn our subscribers’ trust, our Data Processing Agreement (“DPA”) has been updated to provide our customers with contractual commitments regarding our compliance with applicable EU data protection law and to implement additional contractual provisions required by the GDPR. Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs): Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”) are company-wide data protection policies approved by European data protection authorities to facilitate intra-group transfers of personal data from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to countries outside the EEA. BCRs are based on strict privacy principles established by European Union data protection authorities and require intensive consultation with those authorities. Subscribers can find the full list of approved entities on the Binding Corporate Rules Approved List here. In 2017 Zendesk completed the EU approval process with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner (“DPC”) (peer reviewed by both the UK Information Commissioner’s Office and the Dutch Data Protection Authority) BCRs as processor and as a controller. This significant regulatory approval validated Zendesk’s implementation of the highest possible standards for protecting personal data globally, covering both the personal data of its customers and its employees. Zendesk is one of the first software companies in the world to have received approval for its BCRs; and was the second company ever to receive approval from the Irish DPC. To access Zendesk’s BCRs, please visit:Zendesk’s Processor Binding Corporate Rules which apply when Zendesk processes personal data on behalf of its customersandZendesk’s Controller Binding Corporate Rules which apply when Zendesk processes personal data for which it is a data controller. Data Subject Requests: An individual who seeks to exercise their data protection rights in respect of personal data stored or processed by us on behalf of a subscriber of ours within the subscriber’s Service Data (including to seek access to, or to correct, amend, delete, port, or restrict processing of such personal data) should direct such query to our subscriber (the data controller). Upon receipt of a request from one of our subscribers to remove personal data from Zendesk, we will respond to such request within thirty (30) days. We will retain personal data that we process and store on behalf of our subscribers for as long as needed to provide the Services to our subscribers. Data Protection Officer: Zendesk’s Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) can be reached at euprivacy@zendesk. Privacy Shield: The U.S. Department of Commerce, with the European Commission and the Swiss government, created the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks (“Privacy Shield”) to provide companies with a mechanism to transfer personal data from the European Union to the United States in a manner that provides an adequate level of protection for the purpose of European data protection law. Zendesk has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks to the U.S. Department of Commerce and has been added to the Department of Commerce’s list of self-certified Privacy Shield participants. Our certifications confirm that we comply with the Privacy Shield Principles for the transfer of European and Swiss personal data to the United States. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) issued a ruling invalidating the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield program. We understand that you may have questions around the invalidation of the Privacy Shield and Zendesk’s position in relation to the same, so we have published this blog post to assist you with your queries. France Hébergeur de Données de Santé (HDS or Health Data Hosting) HDS enables healthcare providers in France to use Zendesk’s customer service and engagement platform with confidence that our platform has appropriate technical and governance measures in place to secure and protect personal health information (PHI).

New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 and its Information Privacy Principles The New Zealand Privacy Act in 2020 commenced on December 1, 2020, applies to agencies and maintains the principle-based framework of the 1993 Act. The 2020 Act states that organisations are responsible for ensuring that personal information sent outside of New Zealand is adequately protected and added mandatory breach notification requirements. Singapore Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) The Personal Data Protection Act of Singapore establishes data protection laws that govern the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Data as of July 2, 2014.

Now your customer can interact with your agents in a native environment, making your customer service a seamless experience. What does in-app support look like? In-app support is made possible thanks to a combination of Zendesk API, Web Widgets, and Mobile SDKs. All that means is that your customers will be able to click on an icon in-app that allows them to access your FAQs, submit feedback, or open a ticket. On the company’s end, your help desk is able to interact seamlessly with the customer across platforms, to convert the conversation to a different platform (like phone or email), and to bounce the inquiry to an agent better able to solve it. In-app support is part of Zendesk’s broader analytics and reporting capabilities, which track and analyze ticket resolutions to find bugs and problems best addressed by a self-help resource. What to look for with in-app support Because in-app support is in and of your product, it helps you maintain brand consistency while reducing customer friction. What should you look for in in-app support software? A top in-app support platform will be: Native — Coded for each of the two major mobile platforms (iOS and Android) Intuitive — Easy for you to build and integrate into your brand experience Customizable — Adjustable to maintain brand consistency and customer experience Contextual — Able to gather custom information that can inform your tickets Next steps Want even more of a customized experience? Zendesk provides documentation for advanced customization of in-app support experience, so your developers can build from scratch the native support you need. Whatever your level of customization, in-app help gives your customers the support they need when they need it. Make every customer interaction count We have more to say about this.

For reference, the entire world’s military spending in 2021 was $2.1 trillion, and that was an all-time record. Put simply, disengaged employees are likely costing you, even if that expense doesn’t show up on the balance sheet. Top companies know to account for this, and they invest in employee engagement software to help improve their employee experience. These tools can help create more engaged employees with gamification, employee feedback collection and analysis, and more. That said, it’s important to recognize that employee engagement tools don’t live in a vacuum. These tools exist as a subset of employee experience software. Employee experience (EX) entails everything from pay and benefits all the way down to how friendly your help desk staff are. Employee engagement tools help you tune into what your employees think and feel so you can structure your EX accordingly. To help you leverage the power of these tools, here is a quick overview of everything you need to know about employee engagement systems. You’ll learn what these systems are, what they do, and why they matter. And you’ll get a useful list of what the best tools out there are plus guidance on how to choose the ideal solution for your organization. What is employee engagement software? The five best employee engagement platforms How to choose internal engagement software Common features Benefits of employee engagement tools How to use employee engagement platforms Try one for free So, what is employee engagement software? Employee engagement software is a general term for a range of programs designed to help enterprises monitor and improve their employees’ experience. The aim of employee engagement software is to make employees feel more connected, engaged, and motivated to work for their company. This kind of software often includes features such as employee feedback collection, goal-setting and tracking, and gamification. Depending on the solution, employee engagement software may be folded into an employee experience software or it may exist as a standalone solution. The 5 Best Employee Engagement Tools Employee engagement tools may take many forms. There are tools dedicated solely to monitoring and measuring employee engagement. And there are platforms that fold in several different kinds of employee engagement solutions. As it happens, many of the functions of customer experience software actually mirror those required for employee engagement. Because of these similarities, CS platforms with a broad range of integrations (like Zendesk) can double as powerful employee engagement platforms. To that end, in the section below, you’ll find five examples of the best employee engagement software, all of which integrate seamlessly into Zendesk to create a truly robust employee experience platform. Software Starting price (/user/month) Free trial/plan Key Features SweetHawk $1 Free trial Child-parent ticket workflows Surveys Conditional ticket fields Ticket scheduling Hide ticket fields User permissions for ticket fields SurveyMonkey $30 Free trial Survey sharing with view/edit permissions Survey results analytics Shared asset library Unlimited surveys and questions on select plans Multilingual support Qualtrics Not available Free trial Tagging and segmentation Thematic and sentiment analysis Custom branding support Social, SMS, web, and app-based surveys Employee lifecycle-based surveys Free survey templates LumApps Not available Not available Knowledge management Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace integrations Omnichannel employee communication Corporate social media 50+ connectors with 3rd party tools Platform analytics Pathlight $50 Not available Unlimited data sources AI-powered goal setting Root cause analysis User adoption analytics SSO SweetHawk Image credit With its survey functionality, SweetHawk has primary components of what you need to extend a CS-focused platform like Zendesk into an employee experience system. Using SweetHawk, you can install any one (or all) of their apps to extend a Zendesk deployment. Currently, SweetHawk has 15 apps, including NPS survey functionality and they’re always adding more. You have the option of adding SweetHawk apps one by one or downloading their entire catalog via Super Suite. With the Super Suite you can create sophisticated systems to handle project management, automate HR processes, or create an ITSM change management system. Or, just start small and add their Calendar, Tasks, or Reminders app to get a feel for the software’s interface and capabilities. In addition to adding employee engagement functionality to your customer experience software, you can also enhance it in other ways with SweetHawk’s apps. Among other things, you can use SweetHawk to create custom popup notifications, conditional ticket fields, ticketing automation, and manage SLAs with real-time timers. Based on reviews from G2, customers tend to highlight SweetHawk’s lack of documentation as its main disadvantage and its ease of use and interoperability with Zendesk as the software’s main advantages. A couple things to keep in mind: a Super Suite subscription requires that you subscribe with all paid Zendesk Agents. Also note that with a Zendesk Sandbox account, SweetHawk’s apps are free to use in your sandbox environment. Pricing plans Pick and Choose: Ranges from $1 per agent/month to $100 per account/month Super Suite: $10 per agent/month Enterprise: $15 per agent/month Free trial: 14 days with installation of Super Suite app Features Google and Office 365 Calendar integration Child-parent ticket workflows Approval workflows Surveys Conditional ticket fields Ticket scheduling Change manager for Zendesk Hide ticket fields Undo and redo ticket form changes User permissions for ticket fields Learn more about SweetHawk for Zendesk SurveyMonkey Image credit For many people, SurveyMonkey is one of the first tools that comes to mind when they think of employee survey software. And there’s a good reason for that. SurveyMonkey makes it easy to build and segment employee contacts into lists, distribute surveys to those lists, create custom emails, and graph out survey results in real time. Combine these capabilities with Zendesk’s internal help desk solution, and you’re well on your way to deploying a powerful employee engagement platform. SurveyMonkey’s familiar interface is easy to use and it’s already trusted by your employees so you’ll capture important insights fast. Plus, SurveyMonkey itself has built a broad range of APIs and integrations so it fits seamlessly into sophisticated tech stacks. On top of all that, SurveyMonkey has built its pricing model to be flexible enough to fit the needs of any size business. Based on reviews from G2, customers tend to highlight SurveyMonkey’s intuitive survey publishing interface and trusted brands as its main advantage. In terms of disadvantages, the most common themes are a lack of transparency about free and paid features and unintuitive reporting interfaces. In short, SurveyMonkey makes it simple to stay connected to your employees so you can understand what makes them tick and create policies that enhance the employee experience. Just keep in mind that if you’re using Zendesk with SurveyMonkey, you’ll need the customer lists feature enabled on your Zendesk Support account. Pricing plans Basic Plan: Free Team Advantage: $30 per user/month Team Premier: $75 per user/month Enterprise: Request a quote Free trial: no free trial but there is a free, basic plan available Features Survey sharing with view/edit permissions Survey result analytic tools Shared asset library Free integrations Unlimited surveys and questions on select plans Question and page skip logic Payment processing Multilingual support Learn more about SurveyMonkey for Zendesk Qualtrics Image credit Qualtrics’ takes many of the core competencies of employee survey software like SurveyMonkey and SweetHawk and adds a few more layers of sophistication. Like SurveyMonkey, Qualtrics enables you to collect employee feedback and analyze results. But it steps things up by allowing you to collect feedback over every channel including SMS, web, app, social media, and more. Additionally, Qualtrics also features advanced tools to contextualize employee feedback. For instance, you can create surveys based on key stages of the employee lifecycle. In this way, Qualtrics is very purpose-built because it helps you create surveys specific to the employee experience. In addition to lifecycle-based surveys, you can also build and report on peer evaluations in Qualtrics. Plus Qualtrics goes beyond surveys by enabling employees to submit, comment on, and upvote ideas in a public forum. That way, you can easily capture the voice of your employees on company policies, strategies, and more. If you decide to combine Qualtrics with Zendesk, you can also trigger surveys based on events in Zendesk, and vice versa. So in addition to the deeper insights you get with Qualtrics, you can also save time by using Zendesk to push surveys to employees automatically. Customers that left reviews on G2 often mention the ease with which you can create simple or specialized surveys and the flexibility and power of Qualtrics reporting capabilities as its two main advantages. In terms of disadvantages, the one that seemed to be most common was that the software is difficult to integrate with other tools. Pricing not available Free trial not available Features NPS, CSAT, and CES analytics Multi language support Tagging and segmentation Thematic and sentiment analysis Online reviews and surveys Custom branding support Social, SMS, web, and app-based surveys Employee lifecycle-based surveys Free survey templates Learn more about Qualtrics for Zendesk LumApps Image credit LumApps enables top-down communication (i.e. one-to-many messages) and horizontal communication via the LumApps Social Intranet. In short, LumApps simplifies and consolidates information to internal business communities, social discussions and corporate content. You can think of it as a powerful hybrid tool that includes corporate social media, employee feedback collection, and reporting features. These features include knowledge management, robust analytics, omnichannel community communication, and collaboration tools. And since it connects to Zendesk via native integration, LumApps can help Zendesk customers offer a comprehensive, smooth employee engagement platform. As it happens, LumApps has earned prestigious recognition in recent years. LumApp was named a Leader in 2021 IDC MarketScape Intranet Reports and in the 2022 Forrester Wave. If your company uses Microsoft or Google productivity tools, you’ll be happy to know that LumApps has tight integrations with both Google Workspace and Microsoft 365. Based on G2 reviews, LumApps greatest strength is its intuitive user interface for creating, publishing, and managing content. Where it falls short, at least in the eyes of customers who left G2 reviews, is that the software lacks some of the features they’d expect from an intranet solution. Pricing not available Free trial not available Features Enterprise video management Profile-driven user experiences Knowledge management Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace integrations Omnichannel employee communication Corporate social media 50+ connectors with 3rd party tools Platform analytics Learn more about LumApps for Zendesk Pathlight Image credit By combining coaching, communication, quantified quals, performance metrics, and quality insurance on one consolidated platform, Pathlight empowers team members on every level—employee, manager, and exec—with actionable insights and real-time transparency to fuel organization-wide transformation and performance. With Pathlight, managers can clearly lay out paths to success for their employees and quickly respond to issues with real-time coaching. And business leaders can get the high-level view they need to assess performance at an organizational level. If you read Pathlight’s G2 reviews, you’ll see that many users appreciate how easy the software makes it to assess their performance metrics, including progress towards goals. Many reviewers say this helps them understand exactly where they stand. What G2 reviewers complained about most was Pathlight’s speed and the inability to drill down to a more granular level on performance metrics. Many users also mentioned that Pathlight showing all employees’ performance metrics may not be ideal for teams that prefer more privacy. Pricing Basic: $30 per user/month Standard: $50 per user/month Free trial not available Features Unlimited data sources AI-powered goal setting Root cause analysis User adoption analytics SSO Performance Management 1-on-1s Customizable employee data retention Advanced user authentication Quality Management Learn more about Pathlight for Zendesk How to choose an employee engagement platform Audit your existing tools for fit If you’re a contractor, you don’t have to worry about the compatibility of your hammer and your screwdriver. But tech buyers don’t have this luxury. To maximize its utility, your tech stack has to integrate seamlessly with newly added tools. Not only that, new tools also have to fit the needs and capabilities of the people who use them. The idea is to combine your technology, people, and process so the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Employee engagement platforms are no exception to this rule. So when you’re deciding on the right platform for your team, evaluate how well it will fit in with your existing people, processes, and technologies. Consider extending upon your existing CS software Since CS software often has similar capabilities to those required for employee engagement, it can sometimes be extended to function as both a CS and employee engagement tool. Of course, this requires that you either 1) have the resources to build employee engagement functionality on top of your CS software, or 2) have a CS tool that is easy to extend with native integrations, (as is the case with Zendesk). So before you choose a solution, see if your existing CS software can be extended upon to double as an employee engagement solution. And if you have neither a CS nor employee engagement software, consider deploying one system to tackle both functions. Evaluate cost holistically It’s tempting to judge the cost of a given software based on the first number that jumps out at you, which is usually the software’s licensing cost. But there is so much more than licensing that goes into the cost of software. Though it can only be quantified on a company-by-company basis, every tool has an implementation and maintenance cost, each of which can quickly outweigh the tool’s licensing cost. Moreover, cost shouldn’t be your only consideration — it should be return on investment (ROI). So when choosing an employee engagement platform, you must also consider the benefits of implementing the software. For example, what direct benefit can you associate with the ability to automate the collection and analysis of employee sentiment? Answer questions like these about your potential software choices, and you’ll be much better positioned to choose what is truly the most cost-effective tool. Common employee engagement features Employee survey creation and distribution In the world of employee engagement, collecting feedback is a foundational piece. Nothing’s more important than capturing and listening to the voice of your employees. So if your software doesn’t have surveying capabilities, you should find another option. But just having the ability to create and distribute surveys is table stakes. The software should also make it easy to segment audiences for surveys, distribute surveys to specific audiences, analyze responses, and report on results. Corporate communities for fun and business Employee engagement software often includes community features, like the business equivalent of Facebook Groups. These groups can be built around, for instance, specific disciplines. This allows employees in similar departments or disciplines to collaborate with each other. So subject matter experts can share knowledge and provide help to others when needed. And in this way, communities can help employees find in-house expertise that they otherwise might outsource. Or, you can create communities based on shared interests, so employees can network and bond based on their personal interests. Gamification If you have enough imagination, almost anything can be turned into a game. Employee engagement builds on this by introducing game elements into your employees’ experiences. Using employee engagement’s gamification features, you can incentivize employees to further develop their career through learning, encourage participation in internal corporate communities, motivate performance for sales and marketing teams, and much more. You can also customize your gamification features by adding prizes, like time off, giftcards, or digital badges. The benefits of employee engagement solutions More satisfied customers 78 percent of senior leaders we surveyed for the Zendesk CX Trends Report in 2022 agreed that service agents play a vital role in customer retention. And few would argue that employees are what determine the failure or success of a company. In essence, employee engagement solutions are designed to create more engaged, loyal, and driven employees. The direct result of more engaged, loyal, and driven employees is more satisfied customers. And, at the risk of stating the obvious, more satisfied customers tend to buy more and remain loyal to the company that provides them consistently great service. Lower turnover costs According to a Gallup research, voluntary turnover costs businesses in the United States one trillion dollars. They broke it down by organization too, which is even more scary. With an annual turnover rate of 26.3%, a 100-person organization with an average salary of $50,000 would have turnover costs of $660,000 to $2.6 million per year. And those are numbers from 2017, when job switchers were far less prevalent. Given the lingering impacts of the pandemic on workforce trends, these costs are likely on the low end. The main lever that creates these eye-popping, expensive numbers is the cost of replacing an employee, which can range from half to two times employee’s annual salary. Think of the benefits of employee engagement software this way: if your tool can help you prevent just one employee from quitting per year, that can save your business as much as $100,000. Of course, that’s assuming the employee made $50,000. With a higher salary, the savings can be even higher. Creative and cost-effective employee engagement Employee engagement is literally in the name of the software, so you’d obviously expect it to help your company create more engaged employees. But what’s unique about the way software can help you engage employees is the creative and cost-effective opportunities it creates. For instance, a common feature of employee engagement tools is gamification. Gamification incentivizes employees to complete certain tasks, like hitting a sales target or completing training, with rewards for doing so. Rewards could include something as simple as a new digital badge, points towards a physical reward, or monetary awards. Even small gifts like a coffee gift card can help employees feel more engaged and driven towards desirable activities. And the cost to the business is minimal compared to other kinds of employee incentive programs. How do you use employee engagement platforms? How you use employee engagement platforms depends on your goals. In theory, you can use these platforms to: Create communities based around skills and/or interests Administer employee benefits Manage individual employee and team performance Collect, consolidate, and report on employee feedback Offer gamification to reward desirable employee behavior Conceptualize, create, and publish knowledge articles and/or videos Provide company news and updates Train and upskills existing employees and onboard new ones Practically speaking, you’re unlikely to roll out all these use cases at once, especially if you’re fairly new to employee engagement tools. So when it’s time to determine how you’ll use your platform, the best approach is to choose a use case based on 1) what will have the biggest impact and 2) what you have the resources to accomplish. In many cases, surveys are where businesses like to start with employee engagement systems because they’re both simple to roll out and highly impactful. Once you’ve started to engage with your employee via surveys, you may also have a better idea of what use case to start with next. Try an employee engagement solution for free Managing and improving your employees' experience can’t happen if you’re not collecting, analyzing, and learning from employee feedback. Employee engagement solutions help you take that first, crucial step in opening up a meaningful dialogue with employees. With Zendesk, the simplicity of adding on employee engagement integrations gets you to that meaningful dialogue fast. And the broad range of capabilities available from Zendesk’s integrations make it easy to slowly evolve and iterate from a basic employee engagement solution to a truly robust system.

But with the countless customer relationship management (CRM) platforms available, it’s hard to decide which one is right for you. We’ve made it easy by compiling a list of the best CRM software to consider. Best CRM software platforms Listed in no particular order, here are the nine top CRM systems—see what sets them apart from others on the market. 1. Zendesk Sell 2. HubSpot 3. Less Annoying 4. Sales Creatio 5. Apptivo 6. Insightly 7. Salesforce 8. Copper 9. Zoho CRM buying guide When looking for a CRM solution, our buying guide can help you make the right choice for your business. How to choose CRM software tools Why consider Zendesk Sell? 1. Zendesk Sell Zendesk Sell offers a modern CRM system that’s easy to set up and use, no matter the size of your business. It’s packed with a ton of CRM tools that help your teams maximize revenue by boosting productivity, processes, and pipeline visibility. Zendesk Sell even has a user-friendly mobile app that synchronizes with the desktop experience, so your sales team won’t miss a beat out in the field. The email intelligence tool allows for seamless tracking of all email communication and helps sales reps work more efficiently, thanks to real-time push notifications, activity reporting, and email template automation. Its power dialer allows reps to make calls without lifting a finger, logs and records every call, and provides access to scripts, notes, and out-of-the-box call analytics. Businesses can easily keep tabs on call count, duration, and results. Sell also comes equipped with sales prospecting functionality that takes advantage of an untapped market of over 200 million professionals. Companies of all sizes use Sell to identify prospects and create targeted lists full of verified, robust, and accurate records. Overall, the intuitive and customizable interface means less hair-pulling: Your team can quickly learn how to use all the powerful sales CRM features. These features include: Email tracking and automation Activity reporting and analytics Customizable sales dashboard CRM mobile app Out-of-the-box integrations Contact and deal management Centralized platform When you can fully manage your sales and marketing tools in one place and integrate them with a help desk, both you and your customers win. 2. HubSpot Image credit HubSpot is a popular choice for businesses just getting started on their customer relationship management software journey. With a clean dashboard centralizing all your important CRM tools, HubSpot makes your data easier to find than the “leave meeting” button after a five-hour Zoom call. Like most CRM programs, HubSpot offers customization and features like conversation intelligence and email tracking. More features: Reporting dashboard Company insights Deal tracking Pipeline management 3. Less Annoying Image credit Did you come here wondering, What is CRM software? Less Annoying might be the sales CRM platform for you. The name alone clearly shows that the key selling feature is simplicity, making it a solid choice for small businesses taking their first leap into the world of CRM. Less Annoying also utilizes a straightforward search feature within its contact management system that makes it easy to track down contacts. Other features: Calendar and tasks Simple pipeline management Customization Mobile access 4. Sales Creatio Image credit Built for midsize businesses and large corporations, Sales Creatio offers comprehensive CRM software, allowing you to manage sales, marketing, and services all from one spot. Sales Creatio’s claim to fame is its low-code technology that gives users a wide range of customization options—little to no coding know-how required. This is a great feature if your team happens to include anyone who self-identifies as technologically challenged. Other features: 360-degree customer view Field sales Project management Orders and invoices 5. Apptivo Image credit With an impressively compatible and fully online CRM system, Apptivo allows you to centralize all your customer care needs from any device while using any browser. It boasts a targeted list of features yet still has over 65 integrated applications and a sturdy sales pipeline management system. That means there’s never a wasted moment when tracking prospective customers. More features: Social news feed IMAP email integration Drag-and-drop email templates Developer API 6. Insightly Image credit If you’ve got a gung-ho Google wizard on your team, Insightly may be one of your top CRM software options. Insightly enables you to fully integrate all your customer-relations needs into a program you’re already comfortable using—your existing Google App account. So, your team can spend less time learning new software. If you do end up with questions, however, you might find Insightly’s lack of 24/7 support frustrating, especially if your team is spread across multiple time zones. Additional features: Automatic address book Fast search Web-to-contact forms File sharing 7. Salesforce Image credit Salesforce is a well-known CRM heavyweight. Thanks to its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, Salesforce users can automate many tasks and streamline their workflow. It’s a nifty way to free your team members from tedious data entry and help them focus more on sales. With a long list of features (including commission management and call center management), Salesforce may have more bells and whistles than a small business needs. Other features: Quote-to-cash automation Opportunity management Sales forecasting Document management 8. Copper Image credit Like Insightly, Copper was built with Google users in mind. People choose Copper for its G-Suite integration capabilities. Although its features aren’t necessarily unique, users routinely cite Copper’s easy user experience as its best quality. More features: Pipeline reporting Google integration Project management Task automation 9. Zoho Image credit While many other CRMs are designed for either small or large companies, Zoho CRM is a great option for businesses of all sizes. Zoho CRM comes with the features you’d expect from a top CRM software brand—it even boasts an AI companion named Zia. The folks at Zoho CRM know there are multitaskers among us, so they created Zia to lend an extra hand. Zia can answer your questions, fetch sales reports, and even take note dictation. Additional features: Workflow automation Deal management Process management Journey orchestration How to choose CRM software tools When searching for a CRM solution that’s right for you, consider some key factors before making a final decision. You have a variety of platforms to pick from, and each one comes with its own blend of features, functions, and packages. Think about what combination would be best for your company. Time to value Spending time and money to implement and learn a new and complicated system doesn’t benefit your company. You want a CRM with fast time to value. You’ll see lower ownership costs and be able to hit the ground running in no time when the product offers: A user-friendly interface: With the help of an intuitive platform, you can start using the CRM in just a few hours and have it fully set up within days or weeks instead of months or years. Customization: A wide array of out-of-the-box integrations and powerful APIs let you customize the software to fit your needs without the support of expensive outside consultants—saving you time and money. Easy administration: Minimal admin needs means less money spent on expensive support and resources—and more time to focus on your customers. Reporting features Get a CRM with easy-to-understand analytics so you can improve your strategy and gain invaluable insights into your customers and business. You should be able to customize these features to meet your unique needs. Accurate forecasting allows you to predict growth and revenue. Pipeline analysis helps you see where your prospects are in the pipeline and spot any bottlenecks. Advanced analytics provide historical data, pre-built dashboards, and collaboration tools so you can collect actionable insights. More features to look for include activity reporting, performance metrics, and custom dashboards. Simple setup Some CRMs are hard to install and configure, and you might even need to hire someone to manage it for you. Choose a CRM that you can install easily so you can get up and running quickly. No matter the size of your organization, finding a CRM with a simple setup is incredibly beneficial. Startups have hectic schedules, so learning a new system could fall by the wayside for them. Meanwhile, enterprise companies need something their employees can start using immediately so they don’t skip a beat. Team productivity features The best CRMs offer features to help you maximize team productivity. These basic features include: Email integration that improves efficiency with tools like alerts, templates, and automatic tracking. Sales engagement tools to build targeted email lists with automated email sequences. Task players that can streamline routine actions like customer outreach. Other helpful features include call and text, smart contact lists, power dialers, bulk outreach, and sales triggers. Customer experience features Your team can use certain features to help improve the customer experience and, as a result, strengthen customer relationships. Keep an eye out for CRMs that offer: A centralized platform that helps you manage leads, contacts, and account info in one location. An app marketplace that lets you connect your favorite business apps. A complete customer view that enables teams to share customer data and insights. Additional CX features include API access, mobile apps, and subscriptions that help you track information on specific accounts. Total cost of ownership Of course, your company’s budget always factors into implementing new business tools like a CRM. But if you calculate a CRM’s total cost of ownership (TCO), you’ll see that buying high-quality CRM software for sales is worth the investment. When deciding on a CRM, you’ll likely start by comparing the prices. But bear in mind the extra costs that you might not consider when just looking at the sticker price. You may need to pay for things like: Implementation costs Maintenance fees Consultants Add-ons Some customer relationship management software offers a free version but charges for the functions you really want. Remember—you get what you pay for. Consider investing in a top-notch CRM that will pay for itself in the long run. Integrates with your tech stack It’s important to pick a CRM with an open and flexible platform so it respects your current investments and works with your existing tech stack. By bringing together all your systems and customer data, you’ll gain a complete customer view and a deeper understanding of your audience. When you have a highly customizable CRM like Zendesk Sell, your team members have all the tools they need to do their jobs well in one place. It’s developer-friendly, too, so building custom CRM applications or integrations is easy (and fast). Mobile sales management There’s an app for everything, and CRM is no exception. Several CRM providers offer mobile access for smartphones and tablets, allowing sales teams and managers to keep tabs on their activities, goals, and tasks when they’re away from their desks. This feature is especially helpful for field sales reps who don’t want to sacrifice productivity when they’re on the road. Free trial There’s a reason car dealerships allow test drives—it’s the same reason many CRM vendors offer free trials. Even with the relatively low cost of cloud CRMs, the time and effort it takes to implement new software can still present a risk if you end up disliking it. As you shop for a CRM, take note of the platforms with free trials. Not only will a test run give you a good idea of how well the software meshes with your team and current apps, but it will also give you a free head-start on implementation.

Free trial View demo A guide to HR help desks Last updated May 23, 2023 Your HR department manages a lot — from payroll, policies, employee benefits, to employee experiences. There’s an easier way to manage it all where everyone wins: HR staff get the tools they need to do their jobs well and employees get the support they need, when they need it. Read on to learn why your HR department needs an HR help desk. What is an HR help desk? Why does your business need an HR help desk? What are the benefits of using an HR help desk? What are some core features of an HR helpdesk? What are some use cases for HR help desks? The evolution of help desk software to an employee experience platform Modernize your HR experience with Zendesk Frequently asked questions on human resources help desk What is an HR help desk? A human resource help desk is technology that HR teams use to efficiently manage and solve employee issues and requests. When employees have answers concerning benefits, payroll, medical or disability leave, or any other company policy, they can address it through the HR helpdesk platform, rather than struggling through an endless chain of back-and-forth of emails. HR teams use their help desk to manage requests from multiple channels. They can integrate a self-service portal to streamline their workflows and automate responses for common questions about HR processes. Just as you want to give your customers the easiest and most accessible path to getting their questions answered, your internal operations should allow your employees the same privilege. Because your employees’ time should be as valuable to you as it is to them. Additionally, an HR help desk will also give team members insights into the types of employee cases that reoccur. This enables them to find resolutions preemptively and create standardized processes to fix problems, eliminating repetitive problem solving that eats up everyone’s schedules. Why does your business need an HR help desk? As a business, your customers’ happiness takes precedence over nearly everything. After all, if your customers aren’t happy, they won’t be your customers for long. And without customers, your business ceases to exist. But placing a high priority on your customers doesn’t mean you should neglect your workforce. Your employees aren’t machines, and they can’t be expected to work like one. If a high-value employee feels that they might be more satisfied working elsewhere, there’s nothing stopping them from jumping to the competition. According to Gallup, disengaged employees fall short in three key areas: 37% higher absenteeism 18% lower productivity 15% lower profitability Disengaged employees hurt the bottom line. But employee disengagement isn’t an unsolvable problem. Implementing a standardized system of handling employee requests helps you build a more satisfied workforce, in which your employees know that their issues are listened to and processed in a timely manner. Human resource help desks make it easy for companies to manage high volumes of employee requests, streamline processes, and standardize service delivery and responses. The result is HR teams working more efficiently and effectively, all while providing a better employee experience. What are the benefits of using an HR help desk? Just as with any piece of software, you want to understand the full range of benefits you can get out of it. After you decide on the right HR help desk software, here are some of the key benefits you expect to see impacting your workforce. Improved employee engagement Loyal employees are engaged employees. But all it takes is one or two slip ups to chip away at that engagement. Say you have a hardworking employee who put in a PTO request well in advance of their planned dates. They wait patiently for a few days to hear back with an approval, but hear nothing. They watch as flight prices start to tick upwards, and start to get nervous that their planned trip is slowly sneaking out of their budget. They email HR, only to find out that the original PTO request was accidentally looked over. The time request is eventually approved, but the frustration that grew during the time between the submission and the approval can’t be erased and has led to a poor employee experience. HR helpdesk software helps teams head off communication gaps by setting up a reliable system of handling basic employee requests. The end result is that you avoid embarrassing slip-ups that can have a drastically negative effect on employee morale and engagement. After all, the benefits you offer your employees are part of why they accepted the job in the first place. They shouldn’t have to struggle or worry to make sure they get them. More efficient onboarding When a new employee joins your team, the goal is to get them acclimated to the job as quickly as possible. It’s likely you already have a system for onboarding in place, but new employees are less likely than more established workers to bring shortcomings in the onboarding process to your attention. They’re trying to make the best impression, after all. It’s not a bad idea to do the same. HR helpdesk software gives you the tools to speed along and standardize the recruitment and onboarding process. Being hyper-organized and efficient during this process gives new employees a strong first impression of your company, which helps them set their own standards higher than they might for an organization that has a sloppy or disorganized onboarding process. Give hours back to your HR team Your HR team is likely already fielding the same repetitive questions over and over again. HR helpdesk software comes with a searchable knowledge database that lets employees seek their own answers before turning to one of your HR reps. This saves time and reduces inbox clutter, which everyone from every department will appreciate. Head off issues before they have time to get worse Helpdesk software comes with reports and analytics features that let your management team spot trends and gaps in employee service delivery, such as HR ticket response times and resolutions. Reporting and analytics give you data-driven insight into just how well your HR team is processing requests, so you can make adjustments wherever productivity appears to be falling short. Additionally, some platforms will include options for surveys and feedback, so you can measure employee satisfaction and engagement directly from the source. What are some core features of an HR helpdesk? Core features of an HR help desk include a ticketing system, knowledge management capabilities, and reporting and analytics. Ticketing system Ticketing systems make it easy for HR team members to manage and effectively respond to employee tickets. Help desk admins can set up the system to ensure the right tickets get sent to the right team. From there, HR staff get a single view of all unresolved tickets for them to handle. What’s more, team members can create tasks and alerts for each request, tag and reassign certain tasks to others, and categorize requests by urgency or topic. Many HR departments use automation to respond to repetitive requests. Automation also helps ensure that critical workflows can still happen while maintaining service quality and SLAs. Knowledge base An internal knowledge base or a knowledge management system allows you to capture institutional HR knowledge at scale and ensure a single source of truth for HR team members and employees alike. Knowledge base software helps minimize the time employees spend searching for information and is a great way to deflect potential HR tickets. Knowledge bases empower HR to help their employees the way they want to be helped, which is often via self-serve channels. Reporting and analytics HR help desks give HR leaders the reporting and analytics capabilities they need to adequately monitor and continuously optimize their internal support operations. All interactions can be measured, such as: Article views – which articles in your internal knowledge base are getting the most traffic Requests – what types of employee requests are coming in the most and to which HR teams Response time – how quickly HR staff are responding to requests And more – your team has the ability to track the KPIs you care about most Having visibility into these trends and gaps allows you to make more informed capacity-planning decisions and ultimately improve support operations for HR staff and employees. What are some use cases for HR help desks? Here are some examples of how companies have used their human resource help desks to streamline workflow and improve employee experience in the workplace: An employee started at their job as a recent graduate before they had children. Now an expectant parent, the employee needs to know about policies regarding benefits and time off. But family planning can be a delicate subject at work, and the employee is hesitant to bring their questions to HR. Instead, they use the knowledge base to search for the information. While an HR rep would have gladly answered these inquiries, it provided the employee with a comfortable level of privacy. Several recent hires are starting their new jobs at the same time, but they’re all going to work remotely, and some in different time zones. Rather than having HR reach out individually to each new hire and handle all the incoming and outgoing emails and paperwork, they use their HR helpdesk software to create a self-service portal through which the new hires can upload their information and keep track of their onboarding process. There’s less waiting time in collecting all the relevant paperwork, and the new hires are able to begin their training sooner than they would if they’d used the traditional back-and-forth email chain. An HR manager at a company uses helpdesk software to run a survey of all employees. Satisfaction rates are high in every department except one. Curious to learn more, the manager does a deeper look into the tickets that have been issued within that department, and finds that one of the managers within the department has been routinely making unreasonable requests, and has even made some blatantly improper statements in the workplace. If the behavior were allowed to continue, it might spell major trouble for the company. But the HR manager is able to address the problem without bringing up any specific names, and satisfaction within the team is reinstated, as evidenced by another survey several months later. The evolution of help desk software to an employee experience platform The ubiquity of apps and service across many channels – phone and email, but also chat and platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Slack – has created an expectation among consumers that service be seamless and omnichannel. Think Uber and Instacart. This critical concept is starting to have a broader relevance across different facets of consumers’ daily lives, including where most people spend the bulk of their time: the workplace. Employee expectations are evolving along with rising customer expectations. Your employees, after all, are consumers too, and they expect the same kind of service in their place of work as they do from the businesses they patronize: personalized, efficient, and convenient. An employee experience platform offers a modern way of driving internal support. Capabilities like conversational omni-channel, AI powered self-service, and the ability to make data driven decisions based on analytics, enable you to deliver stellar employee experiences and transform the way your whole organization works. Modernize your HR Experience with Zendesk Your employees want problems solved and questions answered in ways that are personal, effortless, and conversational. Zendesk gives teams of all sizes the ability to deliver conversational experiences, anywhere and at anytime. Channels such as phone, email, and social messaging are available, out-of-the-box, so you can meet your employees where they are, on any device. The conversation stays connected no matter where employees reach out, so they never have to repeat themselves, and your support team members will always have context from prior interactions, improving the overall employee experience. For employees who prefer self-service before reaching out, the HR help center and community forum capabilities serve as the first line of defense, especially for deflecting common issues. AI chatbots make it even easier for employees to find what they need by automatically surfacing relevant articles based on the context of their issue, saving time and effort. With Zendesk, you can also tailor the entire conversational experience to your business’ unique needs using our open and flexible platform.

View the HR app directory Trusted by world-class HR teams Frequently asked questions on human resources help desk What happens when HR and the service desk integrate? When HR and service desks integrate, companies deliver better employee experiences. This typically results in an increase in employee satisfaction, a reduction in employee turnover, and ultimately, better direct and indirect interactions with customers. Happy employees mean more engaged and productive employees, which have a direct impact on a company’s bottom line. In fact, Accenture reported that companies with great employee experiences outperform the S&P 500 by 122%. Can a chatbot help with the HR help desk? Yes, chatbots can help with HR help desks. In fact, best-in-class HR teams use chatbots to answer repetitive employee questions, freeing their teams time to focus on other work. When should I contact the HR help desk? If you’re an employee, you can contact the human resource help desk whenever you have a question or issue that needs addressing. But just as many customers like to handle their issues themselves, many employees also prefer to seek out answers to their questions without involving a human HR representative. This can be especially true in circumstances that are deeply personal or delicate, which is why HR help desks are great for helping employees retain a level of privacy while still finding the answers they need to do their jobs efficiently. Why switch to HR helpdesk? As hybrid workplaces become the norm, and HR departments continue to serve more diverse workforces with varying needs, it’s imperative for HR departments to evolve their processes to better support their team members and organizations. HR help desks are proven to help teams work smarter and deliver better employee experiences.

When agents have to toggle between apps and programs to do their jobs, it doesn’t create a positive employee experience. They’re likely wasting time searching for information, finding it difficult to keep tabs on tickets, and feeling overwhelmed by the number of platforms they use. According to the Zendesk Employee Experience Report 2023: 59% of employees believe that software related to the employee experience is scattered across systems and places. 52% of employees believe that software related to their employee experience is dated and difficult to use. Your team needs a reliable and intuitive solution that makes their jobs easier. Our comprehensive guide details the basics, benefits, features, and best practices of an IT help desk. What is an IT help desk? How does an IT help desk work? IT help desk vs. other solutions IT help desk support features Benefits of IT help desk services IT support desk best practices Your IT help desk solution Customer stories Frequently asked questions Ready to try IT help desk for free? What is an IT help desk? An IT help desk is a software platform that helps businesses provide technical support to employees and customers. When a technical issue flares up with a device, software, or network, internal employees and external customers reach out to the IT help desk for support. Using a help desk allows employees and IT team members to: Troubleshoot problems Track and prioritize their issues Assist with products, services, or processes An effective IT help desk makes it easy for IT support teams to resolve issues quickly and efficiently while providing a customer-centric experience. Who uses IT service desk software? Teams of all sizes can benefit from IT service desk software. From small businesses to enterprises—in industries like retail, SaaS, healthcare, and more—IT departments commonly use this kind of software to provide services to their internal teams. These services include: Server maintenance Software deployment Hardware fixes System administration Incident and asset management Change management How does an IT help desk work? An IT help desk is usually the first point of contact for employees and customers to get help with their IT issues. They can submit a ticket about their issue, and an IT team member will help them resolve it. Or, they can search through a knowledge base with help content to find answers on their own. IT help desk software has a wide range of use cases, such as: Bug fixes in company software General employee questions Incident monitoring New feature requests Problems with the network or VPN Issues with login credentials Device compatibility issues Scheduled maintenance updates An employee can submit a ticket through their preferred communication channel, like phone, live chat, or email. The IT support software creates a help desk ticket for each issue in a central location. An intuitive user interface enables the IT team to share information and work on multiple tickets simultaneously. A single issue may require input from different departments, making collaboration capabilities essential. IT help desk vs. other solutions IT help desks often get confused with other problem-solving solutions, with terms frequently used interchangeably. While they may live under the same umbrella, there are key differences in functionalities and responsibilities that set IT help desks and other solutions apart: IT help desk: A reactive solution equipped with ticketing software that provides technical support to users as needed. IT service desk (ITSD): A help desk with expanded capabilities, including self-service, workflows, and proactive support methods. Ultimately, an IT service desk’s goal is to resolve issues quickly, maintain services, manage incidents, and fix issues that impact business goals. IT service management (ITSM): Facilitates the delivery of IT services, including problem management, incident management, asset management, and service request management. Desktop support: Focuses on hardware issues, like fixing desktop computers and laptops. IT help desk support features The right IT help desk support features can help agents deliver support that exceeds employee expectations. Here are a few key features to look for when picking an IT support help desk solution for your business. Omnichannel ticketing system An omnichannel ticketing system provides a centralized hub for IT teams to effortlessly manage employee conversations and respond to requests from a myriad of channels. Employees can reach out from any channel—like Slack, Microsoft Teams, email, or SMS—to report an issue. Omnichannel ticketing creates a ticket that includes key context to help support agents resolve issues and provide personalized service. The system can configure and prioritize tickets that are automatically routed to the agent best suited to handle the request. Routing can be based on expertise, availability, and workload. Collaboration tools allow agents to engage with management or teammates to get help or opinions on an issue without leaving their workspace. AI-powered self-service Create a knowledge base and deploy AI-powered chatbots to help employees help themselves. A self-service portal allows employees to find information on their own and get quick answers to frequently asked questions without involving an agent. AI chatbots can engage with employees and offer self-service resources. These AI bots use machine learning, improving the quality of service with each interaction. You can also create a place in the knowledge base for senior-level employees to share their knowledge with new hires. An internal help center like this can deflect potential tickets, making the ticket volume in the queue more manageable. Workflows and automation Creating ticketing workflows for IT help desks helps your teams stay organized and handle requests efficiently. Configure workflow automation based on criteria like: Time received Request type Channel Employee information Organize your workflows with customizable options, like adding reference numbers and priority statuses to tickets. You can also set alerts and notifications for overdue or escalated tickets that must be addressed immediately. IT help desk software that includes an issue tracking system helps development teams track bugs by batching tickets with similar problems. Chances are, several employees will encounter issues related to the same bug, so you can streamline workflows by grouping tickets. Reporting and analytics IT help desk reporting and analytics tools can help you uncover trends, gather insights, and improve your employee support system. Pre-built dashboards provide real-time help desk metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) based on industry standards, so you can start generating reports quickly. Custom reporting lets you create a personalized view with the metrics most relevant to your business. For example, you can create a custom dashboard with outputs including ticket data, performance stats, response times, first-contact resolution times, and more. These reporting options provide valuable insights into what you’re doing well and where you need to improve, so decision-makers can refine operations, make improvements, or reallocate resources. Apps and integrations Integrations allow you to add apps and tools to your IT help desk to create a customized platform or enhance existing tools. For example, you can integrate additional messaging channels like WhatsApp Business based on your employee feedback. Platforms like Zendesk have a robust library of pre-built integrations, with over 1,300 apps to boost the employee experience. Benefits of IT help desk services Investing in the best IT services help desk offers several perks for your business. From improving efficiency to boosting employee satisfaction, an IT help desk can enable you to scale your business quickly. Here are common benefits of IT help desk support. Increases operational efficiency and reduces operational costs The workplace has evolved past brick-and-mortar office spaces into remote and hybrid models. As business leaders adapt, it’s important to update rigid, outdated systems to help desks that enable a frictionless agent experience, increase operational efficiency, and reduce operational costs. A robust help desk IT support system gives users a faster and more efficient way to get past IT issues. Provide your teams with a centralized platform to turn to so they can either solve the issue independently or find the right person to contact for assistance. Reduces data silos and integrates your tech stack An IT help desk can consolidate fragmented customer and employee data from multiple systems and apps in a single place. This helps you unify data, provide reps with more context, and break down data silos. Removing data silos helps keep your team in sync so your organization can run like a well-oiled machine. When someone needs a new power supply cable or the entire printer network suddenly crashes, seamless communication between teams is crucial. An IT help desk with centralized, omnichannel support—that syncs with channels like SMS, social media, email, call center software, and more—empowers your team to provide high-quality, personalized service, especially when serving internal teams. Here are a few apps to integrate with your IT help desk to improve communication and collaboration: Slack encourages team communication, so everyone stays in the loop when issues arise. JIRA provides engineers and support teams with a holistic view of customer issues, allowing them to collaborate for faster resolutions. Okta Actions helps IT and tech support teams perform actions like password resets, account suspensions or deactivations, and clearing existing user sessions. Additionally, an IT help desk should seamlessly integrate with your existing tech stack. This allows your team to start using it right away without having to learn a new system or sit through hours of additional training. Boosts employee productivity Some IT support technical issues can be resolved quickly with the right instructions. But if not everyone knows where to find those instructions, frustration levels can increase the longer someone has to search for a solution. IT help desks provide employees with a way to solve their problems in just a few clicks, so there’s no need to tie up IT staff with phone calls and several rounds of questions. IT help desks allow team members to operate more efficiently by providing the tools they need—such as a help desk ticketing system and automated customer support—to manage and resolve IT-related requests effectively. By organizing tasks and improving workflows, IT teams can be more productive and focus on pressing matters or strategic work. Improves employee retention and reduces employee churn Employees want their company to offer them the same quality of service it offers to customers. Investing in an effective IT help desk can increase employee satisfaction and set your teams up for success, resulting in more productivity and better quality work. By providing the right help desk tools that employees need to do their jobs, businesses can retain employees longer and offset the costs of hiring a replacement—which can be as much as four times the position’s salary. Enhances data security IT help desk solutions sync with customer relationship management (CRM) software to utilize personal data, so security and compliance are crucial. Access and encryption features help users protect their information. There are several product security options to consider in an IT help desk. These can include: Single sign-on (SSO) Two-factor authentication Configurable password rules Redaction capabilities Your cloud-based IT help desk vendor should comply with industry security standards and complete regular comprehensive audits of their applications, systems, and networks to ensure they comply. IT support desk best practices According to our CX Trends Report, 71 percent of businesses plan to increase spending on personalization over the next year. That means businesses should focus less on the number of tools or the latest software and instead implement the right software for their needs. Here are the top IT support best practices for your IT help desk. Pick an effective ticketing system: Track, manage, and organize employee ticket requests with an omnichannel ticketing system. Determine service level agreements (SLAs): Create written agreements to ensure IT teams meet quality, availability, or timeline expectations for internal teams. Fine-tune your IT help desk staffing needs: Take advantage of IT help desk free trials to determine how automation, AI, and self-service resources can balance your workforce. Capture employee feedback: Send surveys to employees after you resolve their issues to measure satisfaction and improve your IT help desk and processes. Develop an employee-centric culture: Create a nurturing environment for employees to develop their skill sets through training, promote well-being, and provide tools to set them up for success.

Customer stories Businesses of all sizes trust Zendesk to help them improve internal operations, build better employee relationships, and transform the modern workplace. Here are just a few businesses that found success from implementing Zendesk. Redfin Redfin is an innovative real estate brokerage with a unique business model: Agents get paid based on customer satisfaction, not commission. As the business grew, Redfin needed a system to help organize and track employee requests. It implemented Zendesk for several teams—including IT, marketing, design, analytics, and dev—streamlining workflows and maximizing efficiency. Redfin set up Zendesk quickly and found it to be user-friendly, allowing its teams to start using it with minimal training. “One of my favorite things about [Zendesk] Support is that I can take someone who has never used a ticketing system and get them up to speed in less than an hour,” says Mac Jonson, director of IT help desk, product support, and customer service at Redfin. Zendesk enabled Redfin to create an internal customer service team to handle employee requests, freeing their dev team to focus on their product. Shopify When Shopify experienced a major boom in business, it needed an agile IT help desk to keep up with its growth. The e-commerce platform experienced a fast time to value, switching between its prior help desk and implementing Zendesk the same day. Agents were up to speed immediately, using the flexible and intuitive platform out of the box. With pre-built integrations from Zendesk, Shopify created the platform it needed to boost efficiency and reduce churn. Over the years, Shopify rolled out Zendesk to other departments, including the HR and IT teams, to continue growing from the inside out. Zendesk has helped Shopify achieve: 92% average CSAT score 170,000 monthly conversations $20 billion in sales Vodafone Five agents covering internal requests for 15,000 users require robust ticket management software to organize, track, and collaborate on support tickets. After a fully functional free trial of Zendesk, Vodafone, the world’s leading mobile telecommunications company, invested in the software to do just that. It took the team only 30 minutes to get up and running with Zendesk, including customizing the look and feel. Now, Vodafone agents easily collaborate on tickets to find fast resolutions, while triggers and automations handle frequent support requests (like password resets)—reducing tickets by 70 percent. The deflected tickets allow agents to focus on more pressing needs, which boosts overall employee productivity. “Our agents love [Zendesk] because it offers the perfect balance of simplicity and power,” says David Bedelis, learning technologies specialist at Vodafone. Frequently asked questions Learn more about IT help desks with answers to these common questions. What is the difference between a help desk and a service desk in IT? IT service help desks and IT help desks both handle incident management commonly referred to as “break-fix.” But IT service desks also handle service request fulfillment, self-service, and reporting. Essentially, they include IT help desk capabilities as well as avenues for fielding new requests and providing self-service options and knowledge management for employees. Depending on the structure of an organization, the tasks between the service desk and the help desk may intertwine. The exact responsibilities vary from company to company, so there’s no need to be too strict with definitions. What is the difference between help desk and desktop support in IT? IT help desk support provides more comprehensive assistance with a company’s IT processes, software, or systems. Meanwhile, desktop IT support offers help to front-end computer users. Desktop support technicians work with end users to troubleshoot network and software issues. They commonly interact with the user through voice or live chat software and coach the user through each step to solve the problem. If the issue is particularly complicated—or if the user isn’t tech savvy—the desktop support technician can usually remotely connect to the user’s computer to gain control and navigate the system themselves. What is the difference between IT help desk and technical support? Many companies use these terms interchangeably, and, depending on the company, may serve the same functions. Generally speaking, technical support experts tend to solve more complex technical issues than help desk technicians. For instance, say your printer isn’t working. If this is an isolated hardware issue, you would call the help desk.

Learn more about how Zendesk stacks against the competition: Zendesk vs. competitors at a glance How Zendesk beats the competition Customer stories FAQs Try Zendesk for free Zendesk vs. competitors at a glance To create a successful customer service team, you need several key ingredients. Checking every box is difficult for many teams, as their features and tools force them to make tradeoffs. For example, legacy enterprise systems—like Salesforce, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, Pega, and ServiceNow—provide tools that help personalize the customer experience and scale with growing businesses. However, they come with high costs and low agility. On the flip side, emerging support platforms—like Freshworks, HubSpot, Intercom, Help Scout, Gladly, Kustomer, and Dixa—offer agile tool sets at lower price points but fall short with personalization and scalability. Zendesk is built for customer service and intended to scale and adapt to businesses of all sizes, so our platform’s resume speaks for itself. But how does Zendesk compare to the competition? Use the comparison chart below to see how Zendesk stacks up against legacy enterprise systems (like Salesforce, Microsoft, and SAP) and SMB support tools (like Freshworks, HubSpot, and Kustomer). Check out the software tools and features at a glance and discover which platform is the best customer service software for your business.

Zendesk is more than a team competing for a trophy in customer service excellence. Zendesk strives to separate from the competition and stand alone as the authority in the industry. Here are a few ways Zendesk outshines competitors. Exclusive focus on the customer experience If you want to create the best customer experience, you want a platform made specifically for customer service. Built with a focus on CX, Zendesk empowers your customer service team with the right tools to deliver personalized experiences across the customer journey. Zendesk provides businesses with a unified, integrated omnichannel solution that allows them to build meaningful connections through rich conversations on any channel. These channels—like social messaging apps, phone, email, and SMS—are available out of the box so you can meet customers where they are with fast, convenient service. You can also deploy AI-powered chatbots that can engage with customers and provide a unique interactive experience. Fast time to value at enterprise scale When time is money, seamless implementation of a new customer service platform is crucial. Zendesk offers a low cost of ownership due to its quick and simple setup, ease of use, thousands of out-of-the-box and customizable integrations, and minimal administrative needs—allowing you to see the value of your investment immediately. Flexible software that adapts to business growth and evolving customer needs is imperative for success. Zendesk is an open platform built to grow with scaling businesses. Investing in Zendesk can help you level up your customer experience and enhance the employee experience with the right tools that set them up for success. Consistently highest ROI To build a loyal customer base, combine great customer service with a solution that helps your team provide that high level of service. Zendesk offers an omnichannel solution that gives you the tools to improve customer support and boost your ROI. In a 2021 study by Forrester, Zendesk for enterprise increased the ROI of some businesses by 286 percent over a three-year period. They were able to achieve this through: Cost savings from deflected tickets and reduced handle time Balanced staffing due to improved agent efficiency Faster integration and time-to-value savings Additional annual revenue As a trusted leader in the customer service industry, Zendesk can help your teams deliver an immersive CX experience that keeps customers coming back. Our flexible and agile platform provides AI-powered chatbots, self-service portals, a unified agent workspace, and other features to foster a great experience for employees and customers. Easy, convenient support means less customer churn, higher customer satisfaction, and stronger customer loyalty—the ingredients of a consistently high ROI. Learn how Zendesk can increase your ROI with our ROI calculator. Best total cost of ownership (TCO) at scale The total cost of your customer service software is often more than your monthly subscription price. Many platforms have hidden costs that can include: Implementation costs by a third-party consultant or internal resource Training costs to get your agents up to speed on a new system Maintenance costs for bug fixes and software updates Add-ons or upgrade costs Staffing costs to fill the gaps from missing features, like automations Downtime costs for unstable systems Zendesk is simple to set up and has several out-of-the-box features that allow you to jump right in on day one. The intuitive interface makes it easy to use, shortening the agent learning curve. It also comes equipped with self-service options, reporting and analytics tools, and a marketplace full of apps and integrations so you can build the best system for your business. Seamless omnichannel customer experience The best customer service solutions eliminate all barriers for customers to get the help they need. Using Zendesk, you can truly create a seamless omnichannel customer experience that enables agents to quickly resolve issues, deliver personalized experiences, and build customer relationships. An omnichannel customer experience is about more than simply providing multiple communication channels for customers. It’s about delivering a richer experience by creating connected and consistent customer interactions across channels. For example, an agent can invite a customer to join them on an alternative channel that can enhance the experience, like switching to voice when messaging back and forth is taking too long. The conversation history and context travel with them from channel to channel, so they can pick back up right where they left off. Our complete messaging solution provides a convenient way to maintain a continuous conversation with your customers. Zendesk features messaging tools that work right out of the box so you can meet customers wherever they are. They’re customizable, too—with low or no coding—so you can tailor them to fit your business needs. Zendesk also makes it easy to add channels to your website or mobile app. These messaging options include: SMS and WhatsApp for Business Social messaging channels like Facebook Messenger Business productivity tools like Slack Frictionless agent experience Zendesk creates a frictionless agent experience by empowering teams with a complete and unified toolset. A frictionless agent experience begins with an intuitive interface that lets you connect easily with your customers, no matter the channel. The Zendesk Agent Workspace is a customizable interface with tools and customer conversations all in one place. Agents can access the information and customer context they need when an interaction begins, allowing them to maintain relevant, personal conversations. All departments have the same view, too, breaking down data silos and fostering better collaboration across the business. Automating repetitive tasks helps streamline workflows, and self-service options deflect tickets, keeping the workload more manageable for your agents. Simply put, our support platform makes it easier for agents to do their jobs, allowing them to spend less time navigating different systems and apps and more time providing a seamless customer experience. 360 customer view A 360-degree view of the customer means facilitating data and integrations across the entire business and tech stack in one place. This unified view helps you align customer support with the rest of your business. It gives anyone touching the account the context they need to better serve the customer and provide a more personalized experience. Zendesk comes equipped with a 360 customer view that gives team members better visibility into the entire customer journey—like previous interactions, order history, channel preferences, behaviors, resolved issues, and open tickets—instead of only showing the current customer request. With all information in one place, your agents don’t need to waste time toggling between systems and apps to find important customer data. This improves the agent experience and boosts the customer experience by eliminating a major pain point for customers: repeating themselves. Additionally, integrations with collaboration tools like Salesforce, Shopify, JIRA, and Slack make internal communication easier. Meanwhile, the Zendesk API lets you add functionality to boost the agent experience—you can create automations for migrating ticket data, make bulk edits, create custom tickets, and more. Zendesk customers and industry leaders are leveraging the Zendek API and the wealth of integrations from the Zendesk Marketplace to form a tailored, 360-degree view of the customer across their business. Deep operational and product insights Zendesk offers robust reporting and analytics software that allows you to capture the insights you need to make informed decisions. Our tools show you where your business excels and where you can improve—whether that’s your business operations, customer service, or product performance. For example, you can see which help center articles are the most effective with self-service for a particular issue or measure the efficiency of AI at solving tickets across channels. Our native analytics tools come with pre-built dashboards for every channel, so you can see valuable information in real time, out of the box. Zendesk allows you to customize reports, metrics, charts, filters, and dashboards with point-and-click configuration, so you can easily create a tailored experience. Your solution should permit you to drill into your data to better understand what contributes to the metrics you see. The best customer service software should also allow you to store user profile attributes so you can personalize every customer interaction and improve the overall experience. CX best practice expertise and community With Zendesk, you can leverage world-class experts to help you build the best customer experience. With our active online community forums, Zendesk empowers customers to connect, collaborate, and share their expertise. We also feature partner programs that offer customer onboarding and support training. Customer experience best practices evolve with changing customer preferences and behaviors—Zendesk helps you stay on top of trends so you can position your business as a CX-pert. Zendesk will also be with you throughout your customer journey to help you get started, fine-tune your CX, and guide you through transitions as your business grows. AI Zendesk is on the cutting edge of technology, using AI and machine learning to create a great experience for customers and employees. Zendesk uses chatbots that employ natural language processing (NLP) to engage with customers across channels. Zendesk also features intelligence in the context panel that offers agent assistance, skills-based routing, and intelligent triage to simplify agent workflows. Zendesk AI is an advanced bot that comes pre-trained to understand the top customer service issues. It can understand customer sentiment, intent, and language and continuously learns to provide better CX. It sets up quickly with almost no technical support required, so you can start reaping immediate benefits. With automation, self-service, and AI on the rise, leveraging these features can help you deliver high-quality support while establishing yourself as an industry leader and expert. Self-service According to the Zendesk Customer Experience Trends Report 2023, 37 percent of customers get frustrated when they can’t complete simple tasks on their own. Zendesk offers a variety of self-service tools that provide customers with convenient support on demand. These self-help resources include: AI-powered chatbots Customer portals Help center articles Community forums Self-service options are also beneficial for your support team because they help deflect tickets, reducing agents’ workload. Additionally, Zendesk bots enable you to provide 24/7 customer service, so buyers can get help even when agents are offline. Bots can immediately greet customers to deliver proactive support and provide knowledge base content (such as help center articles and FAQs) to help customers find quick answers. Customer stories Making the switch is easier than you might think. Check out the companies that switched to Zendesk and see how their business and customer base benefited. Limeade: From Salesforce → Zendesk It’s hard to make Limeade when your customer service software keeps serving you lemons. The employee well-being software pioneer needed an agile customer support solution to help the team understand customer pain points and where they could make improvements. Limeade first tried Salesforce, but the product’s complexity and inability to adapt without help from a developer made it difficult for the company to achieve its goals. Ticket management with Salesforce was complicated to prioritize, too. The analytics tools only provided limited metrics and information the team needed to create solutions for customer pain points. Zendesk provided a seamless implementation process over the course of only three weeks. Since switching to Zendesk, Limeade’s user base has increased by 60 percent—and it didn’t have to increase its customer support staff. Limeade now has six branded knowledge bases with feedback loops that help the team boost their overall CX. “Moving to Zendesk is going to save us money in the long run,” says Ryan Putnam, Limeade’s director of customer service. “With more repeatable processes, macros, automations, triggers, and better insights, we can reduce our incoming volume. And with the translation and localization capabilities supporting our global strategy, it will pay for itself.” Read more about Limeade’s success with Zendesk. Clutter: From Kustomer → Zendesk Clutter, formerly MakeSpace, is an innovative storage space service that originally used Zendesk as its customer support solution. After some staff changes, Clutter switched to Kustomer, which promised lower pricing, a simple interface, and a personalized experience. Kustomer did not fulfill these promises and even became unresponsive to communications. Sean Benedict, CX operations manager at Clutter, wanted to move from Kustomer to an experienced company with proven long-term success, like Zendesk. “The thinking was, if we’re going to move, it should be to Zendesk because I don’t want to move to another younger company, another startup, and then just be in the same position that we’re in two or three years from now.” Clutter sent Kustomer packing and returned to Zendesk. The company seamlessly picked up where it left off, made additional upgrades, and even had Zendesk build a custom app. Since switching back to Zendesk, Clutter has seen an 11 percent improvement in CSAT, a 63 percent increase in agent efficiency (year over year), and a 28 percent improvement in first reply time. Read more about Clutter’s success with Zendesk. Monese: From Intercom → Freshdesk → Zendesk For Monese, the third time was the charm. The creators of the banking app that makes it easy for people to transition their finances when relocating to another country rely on their customer service for success. Monese initially used Intercom as its live chat provider. But Monese quickly learned that it needed a single platform that could centralize conversations and adapt as the company scaled. Monese tried Freshdesk but had issues integrating the Intercom live chat software and received spotty service that tanked the quality of its customer service. “We were having some difficulties with the Freshdesk call side,” said Lauri Haav, Monese’s head of customer loyalty. “We had massive problems with call drops, mixed calls—calls would just mysteriously disappear, never actually reaching the agents. The Freshdesk voice product wasn’t good enough for us.” After two strikes with customer service software, the company switched to Zendesk. Zendesk provided Monese with fast, reliable API and strong omnichannel support. With Zendesk, Monese saw a 10 percent increase in CSAT and a 59 percent decrease in first response time. Read more about Monese’s success with Zendesk. FAQs Why is Zendesk so popular? Zendesk is the customer support software of choice because we specifically built it to enhance the customer and employee experience. Here are a few reasons why Zendesk continues to be a popular solution: Easy implementation: Our products are simple to set up and use. Powerful reporting and analytics: Pre-built and custom dashboards can be tailored to your unique needs. Built to scale: Our flexible platform can handle the scale as your business grows. Innovation: Our development teams continuously focus on improving our product. Partnership: Account and success teams are always available for support. Why is Zendesk better than any other alternative out there? Businesses see Zendesk as a better alternative to their current customer service software because we’re a trusted advisor and considered experts in the market. We empower customers with the tools to become CX experts and provide a reliable platform that’s easy to implement, resulting in the best ROI. Is Zendesk better than Salesforce? Although Zendesk and Salesforce are both leaders in the customer service software market, these five core differentiators set Zendesk apart: Fast time to value Low total cost of ownership Strategic partnerships Omnichannel conversations Architecture Additionally, you can supercharge your system with a Salesforce and Zendesk integration that improves customer satisfaction with streamlined conversations, increases the effectiveness of reporting and analytics, and keeps sales and customer support teams in sync for easier collaboration. Which is better: HubSpot or Zendesk? Zendesk is a proven leader in CX, providing a flexible solution built to support businesses throughout their entire journey. Unlike HubSpot Service Hub, Zendesk prioritizes the agent experience as much as the customer experience. HubSpot does not offer a true omnichannel workspace for agents, and many public reviews describe a slow user experience—most notably around switching between tickets.
